- [00:55](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=55s) 📜 Brandon Sanderson introduces "Sanderson's Laws," a set of principles he developed for writing fantasy and science fiction.
- [01:50](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=110s) 🚧 Sanderson shares an experience from writing Mistborn, where he realized the importance of avoiding last-minute, unforeshadowed solutions in storytelling.
- [04:02](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=242s) 🧩 Sanderson defends sci-fi/fantasy, emphasizing that any genre can introduce unsatisfying solutions, and the key is to avoid using unestablished elements to resolve conflicts.
- [06:44](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=404s) 🔮 Sanderson introduces "Sanderson's First Law": "Your ability to solve problems with magic in a satisfying way is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic."
- [09:51](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=591s) 🧙 Sanderson discusses the debate on whether magic systems should have rules, highlighting the spectrum between a sense of wonder and problem-solving with magic.
- [12:27](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=747s) 🛠️ Sanderson explains the satisfaction readers derive from characters using established tools in a story and how it applies to magic systems.
- [16:35](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=995s) 🔄 Sanderson contrasts the hard magic system of the One Ring in "Lord of the Rings" with the softer, more mysterious magic of Gandalf, illustrating the effectiveness of combining both in a story.
- [20:11](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=1211s) 📚 Sanderson cites "Name of the Wind" as an example of a story successfully incorporating both hard and soft magic systems, creating a compelling contrast between rule-based and mysterious magic.
- [22:29](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=1349s) 🌐 Sanderson's First Law is revealed as a law of foreshadowing, emphasizing the importance of hinting at magical elements early on to avoid unsatisfying solutions in later parts of the story.
- [23:23](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=1403s) 🌟 Sanderson's First Law emphasizes resolving problems in a satisfying way through foreshadowing, allowing readers to anticipate outcomes.
- [24:19](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=1459s) 🎭 Introducing characters to save the day is common, but foreshadowing their involvement adds depth and avoids unsatisfying resolutions.
- [26:15](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=1575s) 🤔 Sanderson's First Law success involves allowing readers to anticipate outcomes, even if they can't predict the specific choices characters will make.
- [27:37](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=1657s) 🌅 Gandalf's arrival at Helm's Deep exemplifies promises and payoffs, where surviving a set time brings the expected resolution.
- [29:01](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=1741s) 🤯 Emotions differ in scenes with external forces saving characters; promises and payoffs impact emotional engagement.
- [30:47](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=1847s) 🔮 Magic systems are best presented with setup clarity rather than a need for understanding every detail, ensuring reader satisfaction.
- [32:07](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=1927s) 🎬 Mistborn screenplay writing involves balancing tension, avoiding info dumps, and integrating character development during magic explanation scenes.
- [35:57](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=2157s) ⚖️ Sanderson's Second Law asserts that flaws and limitations in magic systems are more compelling than the powers themselves.
- [39:39](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=2379s) 🕊️ Sanderson's Second Law illustrated: Allomancy's limitation (lame form of flying) is more engaging than the power of flight alone.
- [42:22](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=2542s) 🎥 Small-screen adaptations of Superman often succeed due to limited budgets forcing creative storytelling around Superman's limitations.
- [44:45](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=2685s) 🦸 Superman stories often focus on aspects where his powers don't have a direct impact, emphasizing character relationships and personal struggles over sheer strength.
- [45:15](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=2715s) 🚀 When developing magic in storytelling, common paradigms revolve around a character's need to level up in skill, fix flaws or malfunctions in magic, or deal with situations where magic alone can't solve the problem.
- [46:07](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=2767s) 📜 Flaws, limitations, and costs are key storytelling elements, shaping character arcs and narrative structure. Flaws can be changed, limitations are worked around, and costs add tension to both character decisions and magic usage.
- [47:33](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=2853s) 🔮 Flaws in characters or magic can serve as focal points for stories. For example, in "Elantris," the story revolves around a flaw in the magic system, whereas in "Mistborn," the narrative deals with character flaws.
- [48:56](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=2936s) ⚙️ Limitations, both in characters and magic systems, provide unique challenges that characters must work with, not necessarily fix. This can include physical limitations, like having one arm, or constraints in magical abilities.
- [50:18](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=3018s) 💰 Costs, whether in character decisions or magic systems, add tension to the narrative. Strategic use of costs can influence the plot, tie into economic systems, and create compelling storytelling opportunities.
- [51:43](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=3103s) 📚 Sanderson's Third Law: "Before adding something new to your magic or setting, see if you can instead expand what you have." Bigger isn't always better; focus on depth and detail rather than quantity.
- [56:14](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=3374s) 📖 Sanderson's experience with "The Way of Kings" taught him the importance of depth over breadth in worldbuilding. Instead of aiming for more magic systems, focus on expanding existing elements to enhance the story.
- [01:02:11](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=3731s) 🌍 Sanderson's Third Law advises against blindly adding new elements to magic or settings. Instead, consider enriching existing components to create a more immersive and satisfying experience for readers.
- [01:05:52](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=3952s) 🌐 Focus on depth, not quantity, in world-building. Creating three well-explored religions akin to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam can be more impactful than having 50 superficial ones.
- [01:06:47](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=4007s) 🚀 In fantasy and science fiction, the key is to present an interesting problem or hook related to world-building. It's more crucial than overwhelming the story with diverse elements.
- [01:07:44](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=4064s) 🏔️ Embrace the iceberg theory of world-building: show enough to convince the reader, but you don't have to reveal everything. Learn to "fake it" by providing essential details and hinting at the vastness beneath the surface.
- [01:09:09](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=4149s) 🎭 Writing is like stage magic; focus on what's essential for your story. Give readers a glimpse of the depth without overwhelming them. Gain trust by doing one thing exceptionally well.
- [01:10:56](https://youtu.be/ATNvOk5rIJA?t=4256s) ✨ Sanderson's Zeroeth Law: "Always err on the side of what is awesome." Start with a cool, exciting idea, like knights with magical power armor, and build your story around it. Prioritize creating a great story above all.

- [00:00](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=0s) 🌐 Brandon Sanderson emphasizes the importance of worldbuilding in science fiction and fantasy writing.
- [01:50](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=110s) 🤔 Students share reasons for being interested in worldbuilding, including creating cool designs, exploring themes, and escaping from real-life boredom.
- [03:45](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=225s) 🦋 Worldbuilding allows for exploring cultural butterfly effects and addressing real-world problems in a disconnected setting.
- [06:40](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=400s) 🌍 Sanderson cautions against "world builder's disease," where excessive focus on worldbuilding may hinder story progress.
- [08:57](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=537s) 📚 Sanderson emphasizes the challenge of conveying worldbuilding information in an interesting way, avoiding info dumps and using dialogue effectively.
- [11:35](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=695s) 🚫 Authors should avoid encyclopedia-style entries and instead convey worldbuilding through character perspectives, integrating it into the story.
- [14:49](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=889s) 🧱 Sanderson introduces the concept of the "pyramid of abstraction" to balance concrete and abstract language in descriptions for effective worldbuilding.
- [18:29](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=1109s) 📝 Writers should aim to "show" more than "tell," using fewer words to convey concrete details and avoiding unnecessary modifiers.
- [21:38](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=1298s) 🌟 Grounding readers in a scene with concrete details and small, relatable elements enhances believability and allows for gradual integration of worldbuilding.
- [23:52](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=1432s) 📚 In fantasy writing, the decision to lead with magic or world lore can impact the learning curve for readers.
- [24:43](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=1483s) 🌍 Worldbuilding is best delivered through characters' perspectives, using concrete details to reveal culture and history.
- [25:41](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=1541s) ✨ Starting a fantasy book with magic is effective when aligned with a character's goal, making it intrinsic and easy to understand.
- [26:37](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=1597s) 📖 Using apprentice characters or those unfamiliar with the world allows gradual introduction of complex settings, preventing info dumps.
- [29:26](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=1766s) 📜 Incorporating worldbuilding or magic systems through journal entries can be effective, but caution is needed not to make it too vital to the main plot.
- [30:40](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=1840s) 🌟 Consider how your setting enhances your story, whether through epigraphs, songs, steep or shallow learning curves, based on your narrative goals.
- [33:15](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=1995s) 🌐 Avatar: The Last Airbender uses worldbuilding to enhance its story, integrating bending into characters' goals and creating a unifying theme.
- [38:21](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=2301s) 🚀 Firefly's worldbuilding creates an uncaring universe, emphasizing the danger, and turns Serenity, the ship, into a character.
- [41:39](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=2499s) 🚀 The Expanse's worldbuilding makes everything dangerous immediately, forcing characters to make difficult decisions in a harsh, physical environment.
- [42:31](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=2551s) 🌌 Dune's worldbuilding adds tension through the illegality of computers and the centrality of spice, creating a rich backdrop for political and religious conflicts.
- [45:39](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=2739s) 🗺️ **Key Worldbuilding Elements:**
    - Map, wildlife (flora and fauna), magic, cosmology, sky color, climate, terrain, races, and people's characteristics.
- [46:33](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=2793s) 🌍 **Cultural Setting in Worldbuilding:**
    - Religion, government, economics, gender roles, borders, fashion, food lore, history, rites of passage, hierarchy, social ladders, accents, languages, taboos/mores, military traditions, greetings, and swear words.
- [48:50](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=2930s) 📚 **Career Advice for Writers:**
    - To have a successful career in sci-fi/fantasy, aim to produce a book every two years initially, potentially increasing to a book per year. Consider series writing but be cautious about putting all books in the same series before breaking in.
- [53:06](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=3186s) 🌐 **Worldbuilding Effectively:**
    - Not all aspects of worldbuilding need to be explored in every book. Pick key elements that enhance your story and focus on them. Allocate "worldbuilding points" based on your subgenre, emphasizing what enhances your narrative.
- [55:51](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=3351s) 🌐 **Tailoring Worldbuilding to Genres:**
    - Explore how climate variations can enhance different genres: fire for action-adventure, sudden changes for action-adventure, and fog for mystery. Apply unique fashion elements to mysteries, such as masks or rapidly changing outfits. Use military structures/traditions to create star-crossed romances or unique combat-based courtships. Integrate economic factors into horror, like purchasing safety from a pursuing monster.
- [01:06:18](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=3978s) 🌌 Explore unique scenarios for horror in worldbuilding, such as an alien invasion through the stock market or economic pressures leading to terrible decisions.
- [01:07:16](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=4036s) 🌐 Consider imaginative and dystopian elements like a world where escaping nightmares is tied to a higher tax bracket, or everyone being a contract killer, to add depth to your world.
- [01:08:13](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=4093s) 🌍 Emphasize the importance of a narrow focus in worldbuilding; doing one element exceptionally well is better than attempting multiple poorly.
- [01:09:36](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=4176s) 🌪️ Choose a central theme for worldbuilding and interconnect it, like Brandon's use of storms in "Stormlight Archive," influencing climate, flora, fauna, religion, government, and economics.
- [01:11:30](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?t=4290s) 💡 Delve into fantastical taboos and societal norms, exploring the impact on gender roles, inspired by real-world taboos observed during Brandon's time in Korea.
