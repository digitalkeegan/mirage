*As the dust settles in the aftermath of the skirmish with the thieves, you find yourselves standing amidst the festive chaos of the workshop. The towering bear-like person, as well as his Jerbeen and Mapac helpers, are visibly relieved, and the air is thick with tension slowly dissipating. Finally, the massive creature, with a kind and grateful glint in his eyes, addresses your party.*

**Santa Claws:** (Smiling warmly) Ho ho ho! My dear friends, I cannot thank you enough for your timely intervention. Those rascals caught us by surprise, they did. Now, let's get to introductions! I am Santa Claws, and these fine helpers here are my trusty arctic friends! Welcome to the North Pole!

> [!info] Santa's True Identity
> An Insight Check (DC 15) or Perception Check (DC 12) (around the workshop) can confirm that Santa is who he says he is. 

> [!info] The Keepers of Winter
> - Santa and his friends are actually the Keepers of Winter
> - They received the letter from Alderheart, and have already made a new Prime Star, but didn't get a chance to send it to Alderheart

> [!info] 
> The thieves did in fact ambush the Keepers in the middle of the night, scaring away the reindeer (they must still be out there) and jumping Santa before overwhelming the others.

**If the Players helped Santa:** They can return the Prime Star without an escort, otherwise one of Santa's helpers will go with them to make sure it "gets there safely"
