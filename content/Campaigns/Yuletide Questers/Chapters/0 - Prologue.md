# Welcome to Dungeons and Dragons!

Let’s go over other parts of the character sheet. I want everyone to pull out there sheet, and we'll go over the most important parts for now. There is some information you should know before we start playing.

>[!important] Race and Class
>Each character in D&D has a race and a class that help determine what things a character does best. Some of the other information on a character sheet is based on a character’s race and class. 

>[!important] Armor Class and Hit Points
>Each character has an Armor Class (also called AC) and hit points. Armor Class tells how hard it is to hit a character with an attack roll. The higher the AC, the harder it is to hit a character. Hit points determine how much damage a character can take. When a character takes damage, subtract that damage from the character’s hit points. If a character’s hit points reach 0, they are unconscious. You'll learn how to regain hit points later in the game.

>[!important] Attacks
>Each character can make attacks with melee or ranged weapons, or with melee or ranged spells. “Melee” means an attack that is used when a character is right next to a monster. “Ranged” means an attack that is used when a character isn't near a monster. The number after the attack on a character sheet is added to a d20 roll (a roll of a 20-sided die) when a character attacks. The higher the number, the more likely the attack succeeds. 

>[!important] Skills
>Each character can use the skills listed on their character sheet. The number after a skill shows what the player adds to a d20 roll. The higher the number, the better the character is at that skill. If a character wants to use a skill that isn't on their character sheet, the player rolls a 20-sided die but doesn’t add a number to the roll. 

>[!important] Equipment
>A character has equipment they can use to overcome challenges during adventures. They also might find more equipment during adventures.

>[!important] Special Ability
>Each character has a special ability. This ability lets a character do something during the adventure that other characters can’t do. You get to choose when your character uses their special ability, but a character can use a special ability only a limited number of times or under special circumstances

Explain how d20 rolls work with the following example:

>[!help] d20s
>The character Alonzo has a Quarterstaff attack that says “+5 to hit.” When Alonzo attacks with the Quarterstaff, Alonzo's player rolls a d20 and adds 5 to the number rolled on the die. I’ll tell you if that attack hits the monster. If it does, Alonzo's attack also says “1d8+3” The player rolls a 8-sided die and adds 3 to determine the damage dealt by the attack.

Now, we'll go over these things when they come up, so you don't need to remember it all right now. For now, let's start playing!

# Our Adventure Begins from A Far
The adventure begins at the end of [[Deepdraw]], in [[Alderheart]] - the large city at the heart of the Wood. The Winter Festival is in full swing. Celebrating [[HumblewoodCampaignSetting-V1.04.pdf#page=59|Altus]] (one of the gods in this world) those in the wood are playing games and activities - challenging eachother with feats of strength and endurance. No official winner is declared, and all who participate are lauded for their courage and given a special place at the feasting table. This festival is multi-faceted though, and many also use the time to honour the great gift-giving contest that brought about the raising of the [[Amaranthine]] - which is what they call their gods.

At the heart of Alderheart, in the grand open courtyard of the Canopy Market, a massive tree is found. Decorated in fruit, painted nuts, wooden ornaments, paper streamers, and candles - the tree is absolutely stunning, and a must-see for all festival-goers. Unfortunately, the worst has occurred, while attempting, unsuccessfully, to secure it to the top of the tree, a [[Luma]] by the name of [[Alden Whiteburrow]] has destroyed Alderheart's [[Prime Star]], a section of star-crystal gifted to the city by the Keepers of the Winter Festival in Norden. the Keepers being a secretive order that lives on the continent of Norden which lies at the northern pole of the world. 

In response to this, a message has been sent to the [[Tenders]] of the Crystal Expanse. A crop of [[Tenders#SEEDLING|Seedlings]] (apprentices) is being brought together, and an expedition to the heart of Nordan is planned to retrieve a new Prime Star.
