# On the Expanse

The party sets off from [[Hollow’s Reverb]], a small town at the edge of the Crystal Expanse. They follow the map and the compass, heading north through the frozen landscape. 

*As your party ventures into the Crystal Expanse, the air becomes crisp and carries a faint, refreshing scent of pine. Towering crystalline trees, their branches adorned with glistening frost, stretch towards the sky, creating a dazzling canopy that sparkles in the soft daylight. Each step through the snow-covered ground produces a satisfying crunch, echoing through the serene landscape.*

*As your party moves deeper into the expanse, they notice the occasional movement among the trees – creatures adapted to the cold, their fur or feathers adorned with frost. Arctic hares, dart between the crystalline groves, their keen eyes alert to any disturbances. White birds, with their sleek and frost-covered wings, soar gracefully overhead, their calls echoing through the crystalline forest.*

Make DC Perception (that's Wisdom) check.

The party can also make a DC 15 Perception check each day to spot any signs of danger or interest. If a player used the meditation room in [[1 - A Call for Aid]] they get advantage. On a successful check, roll on the following table to determine what they see:

|d6|Event|
|---|---|
|1|The party sees a herd of wooly mammoths grazing in the distance. They are peaceful unless provoked.|
|2|The party sees a pack of frost wolves hunting a caribou. The wolves are hungry and might attack the party if they get too close.|
|3|The party sees a group of snow goblins riding on sleds pulled by polar bears. The goblins are hostile and will try to rob the party if they cross paths.|
|4|The party sees a lone yeti wandering in the snow. The yeti is curious and might approach the party if they are friendly.|
|5|The party sees a frozen lake with a hole in the ice. A friendly seal pops its head out and offers the party some fish.|
|6|The party sees a snowman with a carrot nose and a top hat. The snowman is actually a snow golem that will attack the party if they touch it.|

The party can choose to interact with any of these events, or ignore them and continue their journey. Each event can lead to a combat encounter, a social encounter, or a skill challenge, depending on how the party handles it.

At the end of the first day. The party can make a DC 10 Survival check to find a suitable spot to camp and to avoid getting lost. On a failed check, they either waste an hour looking for a campsite, or veer off course and have to backtrack.

If they fail, roll on the table above.


*At the end of your second day, the landscape begins to change. The towering crystalline trees gradually give way to the sight of the frozen coast. In the distance, nestled against the backdrop of the snow-capped mountains, you see the welcoming lights of a small port town named [[Frost Harbor]]. The air is filled with the invigorating scent of saltwater mixed with the crispness of winter, and the occasional cry of seabirds echoes in the distance.

*As you approach the town, you find yourself on a cobbled street lined with cozy, snow-covered cottages adorned with festive decorations. The glow from quaint lanterns spills onto the streets, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. Frost Harbor seems to have embraced the winter season, with charming snow sculptures and ice lanterns enhancing the town's charm.**

*As the evening sun begins to set - what do you do, or rather, where do you go?*

- *As you look for a place to spend the night you actually walk past the harbour...)*
- *Reaching the harbor...

*you're greeted by the sight of sturdy fishing boats and weathered ships gently swaying in the frozen waters. A wooden boardwalk leads to a gathering of small stalls, where locals offer freshly caught fish, handcrafted goods, and winter garments to those passing through. The sounds of laughter and lively conversation fill the air, creating a sense of camaraderie among the townsfolk.*

Suddenly, a voice calls out to you! 

*"Ahoy there Tenders! Ye must be the Seedlings from Hollow's Reverb!" he calls out with a hearty smile. "Fear not, for you have caught your quarry! Captain Frostwind is at your service. We'll brave the icy waves and reach the shores of Norden before you know it. Step aboard, and let the sea be our guide!"*

> Captain [[Eirik Frostwind]] is Clad in weather-beaten clothing and a fur-lined hood. The Captain is master over a small sturdy boat adorned with intricate carvings that tell tales of past journeys across the sea. His eyes, sharp and discerning, scan the horizon as he prepares his vessel for the journey.
