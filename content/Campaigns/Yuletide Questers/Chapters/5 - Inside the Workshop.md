# Inside the Workshop

*As your party steps into the workshop, the fusion of a smithy and a woodworking haven, the air is saturated with the scent of freshly carved wood and molten metal. The space is a treasure trove of whimsy, adorned with an assortment of enchanting toys and trinkets scattered across workbenches and shelves. Yet, amidst the festive chaos, your attention is abruptly seized by a locked side room. Behind the door, the source of the echoing roars becomes painfully apparent. A colossal figure, unmistakably resembling a polar bear, is discovered hogtied and chained, its powerful form straining against the restraints. The room vibrates with each earth-shaking bellow as the creature struggles against his restraints.*

What do you do?

## If they snuck in...

The players have ample time to remove the restraints. They could unpick the locks (DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)), forcefully break the locks with the person's help (DC 18 Strength) or even use the persons roars to cover the sounds of them breaking the chains by force with hammers (DC 15 Strength). Regardless, the person can be freed without those outside knowing. 

## If they ran in mid-fight....

The players don't have a lot of time, and will need to dedicate time to freeing the person while fighting off the thieves.  They could unpick the locks (DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)), forcefully break the locks with the person's help (DC 18 Strength). Regardless, the thieves will try to stop them no matter what.

## Once Claws is out...

The moment Claws is out, he'll rush to the back of the room, and push a large desk away, revealing a trap door. Underneath, 10 of his his helpers have been kept prisoner.

# The Fight

If the players have dealt with most of the thieves, the release of Santa and his helpers makes the rest flee - even into the storm if it's there.

If the players still haven't dealt with the thieves Claws and his helpers will join the fight
