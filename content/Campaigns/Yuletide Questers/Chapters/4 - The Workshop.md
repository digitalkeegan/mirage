*As you cross over the hill, you're able to see down into a small valley. Nestled within a grove of ancient, snow-covered pines, a single structure stands - some sort of workshop. The building itself is a blend of natural elements and whimsical craftsmanship. A wooden facade, adorned with intricately carved snowflakes and adorned with colorful ribbons, gives the workshop a festive and welcoming appearance. The air is filled with the comforting scent of evergreen and snow begins to gently cascade from a blue sky above, creating a serene atmosphere around the workshop.* 

> [!info] 
> If the party makes to scout out the area, a DC 15 Investigation check will show that they area has another set of footprints, ones that are much, much larger.  

> [!danger] 
> The amount of Vulpin depends on party size. It is supposed to be very difficult, a deadly encounter...
>  3 Players = 6 Vulpin
>  4 Players = 7 Vulpin
>  6 Players = 12 Vulpin
## If any Vulpin Scouts escaped:

*As the party looks down into the valley, they notice that their quarry is speaking animatedly with more Vulpin - in fact, the valley is full of them...*

DC 15 Perception check will confirm they the group can see most, if not all, of them. If the party doesn't move or react, a group of 3 will start to make their way in the direction they've just come from. 

The party could attempt to sneak into the workshop, using the snow and trees as cover. If they are quick they can use DC 15 at Stealth to do so. If they use the trees, it's a DC 10. The scouts are looking for them though!

If they manage to get into the Workshop, proceed with [[5 - Inside the Workshop]]

Otherwise, if combat ensues, proceed to [[4 - The Workshop#Fight]]

## If they snuck past, or if no Vulpin scout escaped

*As you look down into the the valley you realise that there are many more of the Vulpin.... in fact, the valley seems to be full of them...*

DC 15 Perception check will confirm they the group can see all of them.

The party has a few options

### Sneak

The party could attempt to sneak into the workshop, using the snow and trees as cover. They can use DC 10 at Stealth to do so.

### Fight

The party can choose to fight the Vulpin right here, right now. The enemies are spread about the area (unless the fight is a walk in the park, then more come from the woods). If the fight progresses to be close to the workshop a DC Perception (Wisdom) check will allow a player to hear great roars, like that of a large creature, coming from inside the workshop.

After two rounds, the player most familiar with the wild, or the player who searched the library in [[1 - A Call for Aid]] will notice a storm brewing. On the third round the storm reduces visibility to 30 feet. After which the payers will start to be damaged by the driving snow. The Vulpin will seek shelter in the Workshop.

### Ignore everything

No matter what happens, the snow soon turns into a snowstorm. The party will be forced to seek refuge in the workshop at some point.
