# A Call for Aid

The adventure begins with the party of Seedlings being briefed by the Tenders of the Crystal Expanse. They are told that they have been chosen to embark on a vital mission to retrieve a new Prime Star from the Keepers of Winter in Norden.

A large, white as snow, Strig stands before you all. He's not wearing any Tender outdoor gear, but even holding a letter in-hand you can see that the strig has had many hard years - scars, and even a permanent burn on his neck  remind you why [[Cain of the Sunsworn Oath]] leads the Tenders of the Crystal Expanse.

>Hello Seedlings. Welcome to your first mission. We understand that you're still getting settled in here in Hollow's Reverb, but an urgent message has just arrived. Apparently, the [[Prime Star]] of [[Alderheart]] ha been broken, and the city is in dire need of a replacement. We have already sent word to the Keepers of Winter up in Norden, but we have no idea if they've received the call, certainly they haven't replied. So, I'm sending you all to Norden asap to retrieve a new Prime Star! Any Questions?

> - *What's a Prime Star?* Goodness! Don't you know anything!? The Prime Star... the giant star that sits a top the giant tree in Alderheart man! Piece of actual star... given to us by the Keepers of Winter...?
> - *Who are the Keepers of Winter?* Well... we don't actually know who they are... but we know where they are! Right at the heart of Norden!
> - *How will we get there?* Don't you worry, I have a few of the helpers here getting together some provisions - including a sled to help you with the heavier items.
> - *Why aren't more experienced Tenders going?* They're all home for the holidays!
> - *How long do we have?* You should leave asap! If you absolutely need time to ready yourself, you know where the library and meditation rooms are!


Cain and the Helpers provide the party with a map of the Crystal Expanse - an area you'll need to cross ([[CrystalExpanseMap.png]]), a compass, a sled, and a pair of snowshoes for each member. They also give them some rations, a tent, and a few flasks of hot cocoa. They warn the party often that the journey might be perilous but that they should avoid any unnecessary detours or distractions. They also advise them to dress warmly and to stick together.

> [!info]
> If the party decides to look for more information in the library they can do so on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check. They can find the following information:
> - An old scientific paper on the weather patterns of Norden - apparently freak snowstorms can occur, and need to be taken seriously.
> - There are rumours of bandits that use Norden as a base of operations - though not confirmed the assumption is that they have interactions with the Keepers of Winter
>
>On a high number they find an older tomb on Norden. It is almost completely destroyed, but seems to indicate that the Keepers of Winter were set up by [[Altus]] himself, and that it might even just be "*The* Keeper of Winter"
