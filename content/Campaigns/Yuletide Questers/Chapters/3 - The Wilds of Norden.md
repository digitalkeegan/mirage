# The Scouts 

*As your party traverses the frost-laden landscape of Norden, the air biting with the chill of the north, you notice a small copse of trees dotting the snowy terrain up ahead.* 

Make a DC 15 Perception (Wisdom) check.

**Succeed:** *Through the skeletal branches, your keen-eyed adventurer catches a glimpse of movement. Emerging from the cover of the snow-laden trees, a trio of Vulpin cautiously advances. These Vulpin wear white clothes, blending seamlessly with the wintry surroundings, and they move gracefully over the snow with a cautious yet curious demeanor.* 

What do you do?

**Fail:** *Suddenly, emerging from over a small rise, a a trio of Vulpin come across you. Their keen senses detect your presence, and the Vulpin, with eyes as sharp as their pointed ears, lock gazes with your party. The frigid air carries an unspoken tension as both groups assess each other - then, without a word, they bolt away from you back the way they came.

What do you do?

Catching the scouts is possible with a DC 17 Athletics test. If a Vulpin is caught, it immediately cowers, and would give the part anything on a DC 5. The caught Vulpin has a Short Sword, a Short Bow, and a scribbled piece of parchment written in Vulpin. Any player that can read Vulpin can read the note:

Following the Vulpin is easy, and it does not take long to find where they are headed...
