# Adventure Background

The adventure begins at the end of [[Deepdraw]], in [[Alderheart]] at the heart of the Wood. The Winter Festival is in full swing. Celebrating [[HumblewoodCampaignSetting-V1.04.pdf#page=59|Altus]]; games and activities during this festival challenge entrants with feats of strength and endurance. No official winner is declared, and all who participate are lauded for their courage and given a special place at the feasting table. This festival is multi-faceted though, and many also use the time to honour the great gift-giving contest that brought about the raising of the [[Amaranthine]].

At the heart of Alderheart, in the grand open courtyard of the Canopy Market, a massive tree is found. Decorated in fruit, painted nuts, wooden ornaments, paper streamers, and candles - the tree is absolutely stunning, and a must-see for all festival-goers. Unfortunately, the worst has occurred, while attempting, unsuccessfully, to secure it to the top of the tree, a [[Luma]] by the name of [[Alden Whiteburrow]] has destroyed Alderheart's [[Prime Star]], a section of star-crystal gifted to the city by the Keepers of the Winter Festival in Norden.

In response to this, a message was sent to the [[Tenders]] of the Crystal Expanse. A crop of [[Tenders#SEEDLING|Seedlings]] was brought together, and an expedition to the heart of Nordan was formed.

# Overview

The party of Seedlings will set off immediately from the Tenders headquarters within the Crystal Expanse. Journeying from [[Hollow's Reverb]] They will need to cross the the northern reaches of the Expanse in order to get to the sea that stretches between it and [[Norden]]. This is an arduous journey, but thankfully fairly uneventful. 

The Seedlings will need to journey north from the Crystal Expanse and then cross the sea to get to Norden. After journeying into the continent they will eventually hit the north pole. The Seedlings goal is to find the Keepers of Winter - but instead they find themselves surrounded by a pack of Vulpin-like individuals. Wrapped fully in white they pounce on the party, cover their eyes, and haul them off. The players wake to find themselves in a room, stripped of any weapons. Next to their room they occasionally hear the roar of a great beast. 

This "beast" is actually Santa Claws - someone the party thought a myth. Claws has actually been tied up and placed in this room. His helpers, arctic Jerbeens (more hare-like then mouse-like) and Strigs have also been captured. The most likely reason is that this is a band of thieves, here to steal the plethora of toys that Claws and his friends create. Once Claws realises that others have been captured, he implores the adventurers to help. 

After escaping their room, and somehow defeating the thieves, Claws presents the Seedlings with a new Prime Star - it turns out that Claws and his helpers are actually the real Keepers of Winter, and keep the limited number of Prime Stars safe in their workshop's safe.
