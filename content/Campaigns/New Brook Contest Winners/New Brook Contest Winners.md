New Brook Contest Winners is a TTRPG Campaign, originally starting in September 2023. 

It is set in [[Terra 33]], though in the late 20th Century, and makes use of two Game Systems; [[Kids on Bikes]] and [[DotDungeon]]. [[Kids on Bikes]] is used as the "primary" way of playing within the campaign, but the players frequently enter an in-world computer game called [[Adventurers of Annwn]]. When Player Characters play together in this game, the Players predominantly use the [[DotDungeon]] system instead.
