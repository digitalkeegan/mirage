Our story begins in the small, quiet town of [[New Brook]], nestled away in the heart of Tennessee. Here, life is typical for a group of young friendsâ€”school, homework, and the occasional bike ride to the local diner, river, or park. As summer break kicks off, the promise of adventure fills the air, and the days stretch out like endless possibilities.

On the last day of school, on a brilliantly sunny afternoon, you and your friends part ways and head to your respective homes. 

>*As you arrive home, I'd like to know who's there already? How do they greet you?*

Upon arrival, you each find a mysterious package waiting for you. Its sender: [[NexTech Industries]].

>*Before opening the package, take a moment to describe your character's bedroom. What posters or decorations hang on the walls? Is it neat and tidy, or is it filled with piles of clothes and toys? Let the players paint a picture of their personal space.*

Inside the package, you discover a jetblack box, there's no name on the box, no way to know where it even came from if you hadn't already read the sender details on the postal box. But you do have an inkling as to what this might be. 

>*Roll on Brains, you only need a 2*

Yes, as you've worked out, it seems this might be a [[NexLink]] - the new console created by NexTech. Months ago, most of you, signed up as a beta tester in a competition. By some twist of fate, you've been chosen.

>*I'm curious, who of you might think that you wouldn't have signed up for the beta? and if so, do you have any ideas as to how you got the console?*

Okay, so you open the black box, and there, nestled in white plastic is the headset and console. It's astounding! Like something straight out of Back to the Future or Star Wars. The exterior of the headset is a glossy black with subtle silver accents - a perfect place to chuck your favourite stickers on. The visor though is large and curved, made of a crystal-clear material that doesn't seem quite like glass, quite like plastic. As you take the headset away, you notice that it connects to a console unit via a cable, but comes with two wireless controllers - wireless!? 

>*How are you guys reacting to this? Do you call anyone on the landline, rip right into it? Show family?*

As you gather in the comfort of your own bedrooms, excitement fills the air. Like the first time a family member sat you down to watch Indiana Jones after you were old enough...

As you slip on the NexLink for the first time, the world around you fades to darkness, and a soft, soothing voice fills your ears. "Welcome, beta tester," it intones warmly. A brilliant burst of light envelops you, forming the words "NexTech Industries" in shimmering letters before dissipating. With a gentle hum, the headset confirms your status as a beta tester, setting the stage for what looks to be the only game pre-loaded - "The Adventurers of Annwn."
