You have finally found your way to the [[Aurora Peaks]]! Here, snow-capped mountains reach toward the heavens. These peaks are bathed in the delicate hues of dawn, and as night falls, the skies become a celestial display of dancing lights. Legends speak of those who climb these summits finding themselves embraced by the stars, as if the boundaries of earth and cosmos blur. You know, due to your Quest information, that the next [[Luminara Heartstones]] will be found here in the Mountains. The party has successfully made its way to [[Celestia]], a town at the foot of the Peaks. 

After making their way into the city, three Quest markers appear on the screen, one for each minor Quest in the area.

### Dire Wolves

On the outskirts of town you find a villager outside a lumber yard. The villager, a middle-aged man with a weathered face, looks up as the adventurers approach the lumber yard. He wipes sweat from his brow and sets down an axe that's seen better days. His eyes hold a mix of relief and desperation as he speaks:

*"Hey there, travelers. I reckon you're not from 'round these parts, are ya? My name's Lucas, and I've been runnin' this lumber yard for years, supplyin' our town with good ol' wood. But lately, it's been a nightmare. Dire wolves, nasty critters, have been prowlin' the outskirts of town. They've been scarin' off my workers, and I can't get a day's work done without worryin' 'bout 'em."*

Lucas gestures to the nearby forest, where the woods grow thick and mysterious. He continues, his voice tinged with concern, *"I ain't much of a fighter, you see. I've got a family to feed, and this yard's my livelihood. I don't know what we'll do if these wolves keep botherin' us. Y'all look like you can handle yourselves. Would you be willin' to help an old lumberman out? We'd be mighty grateful, and I'd make sure you're well-rewarded for your troubles."*

With an earnest expression, Lucas waits, hoping that the heroes will agree to take on the dire wolf problem and ensure the safety of the lumber yard and the town it supports.

After accepting the Quest, a location pops on the Players' maps.

To make your way to the location, you'll need to roll a D10 Contest (Build) to successfully find their way to the location.

On the way, they also undergo a D6 Contest (Presence). If they are successful, they can come across a wounded messenger bird carrying a torn piece of paper with Morse Chocolates' logo. The message, partially obscured by the bird's beak, reads, "Worker... danger... secrecy... talk... expose...". If they are not successful, they find the same note in the lair of the Dire Wolves.

Once the players get to the Lair, they find 4 Dire Wolves, the Wolves work together but will retreat if two are wounded or die.

![[Campaigns/New Brook Contest Winners/Adventurers of Annwn/NPCs/Enemies/Dire Wolf|Dire Wolf]]

Looting the Wolves will gain the Players a Dire Wolf Pelt:

|Name|Rank|Price|Effect|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|Dire Wolf Pelt|Uncommon|3|Reduces physical connection loss by 1.|

After returning to Lucas, the players will receive 2 Coin as well. 


### The Stolen Aurora Flower

A local herbalist is the location of the next Quest. As you trigger the Quest discussion, you see that he name is Evelyn. She is a gentle and kind-hearted woman, her eyes filled with sadness. *"Greetings, travelers,"* she begins, her voice trembling slightly. *"I've heard that you're skilled adventurers, and I'm in desperate need of your help. Our beloved Aurora Flower, a source of hope and inspiration for generations, has been taken from us. It's an irreplaceable part of our village's heritage."*

Evelyn goes on to explain that the flower's petals are said to carry blessings and can bring good fortune to those who hold them. *"We believe,"* she continues, *"that the flower's theft is not merely a coincidence but part of a sinister plot. Our town is in disarray, and we fear that without the Aurora Flower, our connection to the spiritual realm will be severed. We need brave souls like you to recover it and restore harmony to our village."*

With earnest eyes and a plea for help, Evelyn implores you to undertake this quest, offering not only the gratitude of her fellow villagers but also a reward for your valiant efforts.

Accepting the quest will reveal three different locations on your map, indicating where you can begin your search for the stolen Aurora Flower.

To reach this location successfully, you must roll a D10 Contest (Hands) to navigate the unfamiliar terrain.

Upon reaching the lair of the thief, you discover a hidden chamber guarded by mysterious creatures. The thief is nowhere to be found, but 8 Glowing Sprite guardians are present, protecting the stolen Aurora Flower.

Returning the Aurora Flower to Evelyn and the villagers will not only earn their heartfelt gratitude but also a reward of 2 Coins for your noble deeds.


### The Sickened Ecosystem (Main Quest)

The third Quest leads you to a small clearing in the woods.  A successful  Presence Check (6) provides the following info:

> As you explore the pristine beauty of the Aurora Peaks, you notice something deeply unsettling. The once-thriving local wildlife now appears to be suffering from a mysterious ailment. Birds that should be soaring through the skies are now plummeting to the ground, disoriented and frail. Woodland creatures, once harmoniously coexisting, are now agitated and aggressive, disturbing the delicate balance of the ecosystem.

In the clearing, you encounter a seasoned wildlife researcher named Dr. Eliza Thornberry. She's a middle-aged woman with a determined spirit, clearly distraught by the state of the creatures she's dedicated her life to studying. *"Greetings, travelers,"* she says, her voice tinged with sorrow. *"I'm Dr. Thornberry, and I fear we have a dire situation on our hands. The wildlife of the Aurora Peaks, our neighbors and friends for countless generations, are afflicted by a mysterious sickness."*

Dr. Thornberry goes on to explain that the symptoms of this sickness are causing the animals to behave erratically, threatening the delicate balance of the ecosystem. She believes that the source of this affliction lies within the peaks themselves. *"I've dedicated my life to understanding these creatures,"* she says, her eyes filled with determination. *"We cannot let them suffer like this. We must find the cause of this sickness and put an end to it before it's too late."*

She shares her hypothesis that the sickness might be linked to unnatural elements, ones that do not belong to the peaks' natural order. Dr. Thornberry's research indicates that these elements might have been introduced into the ecosystem by an external force, potentially from the outside world.

With her plea for help, Dr. Thornberry implores you to undertake this quest to cure the local wildlife and restore the balance of the Aurora Peaks. The fate of the ecosystem hangs in the balance, and your unique abilities as adventurers are their best hope.

Accepting the quest will reveal a location on your map halfway up a nearby Peak - indicating where you can begin your investigation into the sickness plaguing the local wildlife.

To reach this location successfully, you must roll a D20 Contest (Build/Hands/Meta) to navigate the challenging terrain of the peaks.

On the way, one player may roll on RNG for a 10. If successful, you come across an injured animal with a Morse Factory badge wrapped around its leg. This unexpected discovery hints at a potential connection between the sickness and the factory, raising even more questions about what might be happening in the world beyond the NexLink. If unsuccessful, this badge is found in the spring at the top of the mountain. 

Half way up the Mountain the forth Quest becomes available by showing up on the map (Seeking the Blessings of the Peaks)

Upon reaching the heart of the sickness-afflicted area, you encounter the source of the ailmentâ€”a corrupted magical spring that serves as the lifeblood of the ecosystem. Sitting in the Spring is Dry Bowser 

![[Dry Bowser]]

Defeating Dry Bowser and purifying the magical spring are monumental tasks, but they are essential to restoring the health of the local wildlife and preserving the delicate balance of the Aurora Peaks. Players will receive the next [[Luminara Heartstones]] - the [[Luminara Heartstones#Harmonic Compass|Harmonic Compass]]

Upon your return to Dr. Thornberry with news of your success, she expresses her gratitude for your efforts to cure the sickened ecosystem. As a token of her appreciation, she rewards you with 2 Coins.


### Seeking the Blessings of the Peaks


As you make your way toward the summit, the path grows steeper, and the air thins. The beauty of the peaks, illuminated by the setting sun, takes your breath away. The journey tests your resolve, but the legends keep you moving forward.

To reach the top will require rolling 18 on any dice.

Upon reaching the summit, you discover a secluded grove surrounded by ancient, towering trees. In the heart of the grove stands a serene pool, its water shimmering with an otherworldly glow. You sense that this is the place spoken of in the legends, the sanctuary of the Aurora Peaks.

Before you can explore further, a presence makes itself knownâ€”a spirit of the peaks. It materializes as a radiant, ethereal figure, its form shifting like dancing light. The spirit's voice, soft and melodious, fills the air as it addresses you:

*"Greetings, travelers. You have ventured to the highest peak, the heart of the Aurora Peaks, in search of blessings. To prove your worthiness, you must complete three trials. Each trial represents an aspect of this landâ€”the Beauty, the Strength, and the Wisdom of the peaks."*

The spirit explains that to receive the blessings, you must pass each trial. These trials are not battles but rather tests of character and understanding. They are designed to resonate with the spirits of the peaks, allowing them to judge whether you are worthy of their gifts.

**Trial of Beauty:** In this trial, you are presented with a challenge that involves creating something of exceptional beauty. It could be a work of art, a melody, or a gesture of kindness that brings beauty to the world around you. The spirits appreciate the beauty that exists in all things. Contest Roll on Presence/Hands

|Beauty - Painter's Supplies|Basic|1|Watercolor, oils, brushes.|

**Trial of Strength:** For this trial, you must display physical strength and resilience. This could involve feats of strength, endurance, or the protection of the vulnerable.

**Trial of Wisdom:** In the final trial, you'll face a test of wisdom and understanding. You may be presented with a riddle, a complex problem, or a situation that requires you to think deeply and make a wise choice. The spirits value those who seek knowledge and make wise decisions. 

"I am the beginning of the end, and the end of time and space. I am essential to creation, and I surround every place. What am I?"

Contest Roll of Meta if they can't work it out.
