[[John Jameson]] of the [[Sun Sprout Times]] have just entered a room, deep in the Chocolate Factory, with [[Ned]], [[Theo]], and [[Silver]]. Inside the lab they have just found [[Cora Morse]] - who clearly knows [[John Jameson]].

[[Frank]] and [[Lolita]] are now outside and they have arrived at [[Lolita]]'s house. 

### Primary Goals:
#### Get Lolita back to the Factory - but not Frank.
- A [[NexTech Industries]] spokesperson meets Lolita and Frank at her house. The kids find the spokesperson (America) talking to many of the Kids' parents (not Theo's). They're around a dinner table, coffees, snacks and chocolates spread around the group as Georgia (Lolita's mom) attempts to host everyone.
- Georgia became suspicious when America kept asking questions about how the kids' experience was in the game, and if they had experienced any "changes of behaviour"
- Franks parents will take him home, no matter what. 
- NexTech escorts Lolita and parents back to the Factory

> **Parents:**
> Lolita: Georgia and Mitch
> Theo: Theodore and Renee
> Silver: Alicia May and Bennet
> Ned: John and Linda

#### Morse has been altering the Beans
- Morse Chocolates has been using chemically altered beans that can cause high levels of addiction - but alters the brain so that individuals actively ignore it. Most people in town are addicted.
	- [[Marshmallow Morse]] has been seeing someone from the FDA and this is how they void being found out
	- [[Cora Morse]] is *well* addicted, and even if some recess of his brain suspects something, he's in too deep to admit anything. 
	- [[Marshmallow Morse]] has been running the factory while his father spends more and more time "testing" for new flavours.
#### John Jameson (and Kids?) "expose" the Chocolate Factory
- [[NexTech Industries]] takes over the Factory - swooping in with an army of lawyers that come *much* too quickly...
