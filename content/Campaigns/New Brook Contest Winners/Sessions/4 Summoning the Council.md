Once the Koopas are dealt with, guided by Mario and Luigi, the Player gathers with the village elders (humans) in the Village. The player is thrust into yet another Cut Scene where the villagers discuss the dire situation and the significance of the [[Silken Sprite]] in maintaining the world's magical equilibrium. As the winds rustle through the leaves, the players learn more about Bowser's plans - he's apparently seeking to merge the two worlds - Annwn, and Mushroom Kingdom (as well as the other surrounding Kingdoms). 


The elders also tell you more about the three artefacts that the Sprite released - the [[Luminara Heartstones]]. These stone can be used to stop Bowser by granting the user a Power Up but only temporarily. The Hero must find all three such stones, and reunite them with the [[Silken Sprite]] to bring balance to the world and oust Bowser and his flunkies. 

Suddenly, one of the Elders speaks over the now the overly-long cinematic. "But, he announces, you can't do it alone! We recommend joining with others to help you!"

Suddenly, a new Screen appears to you:

"Connect to Party"

If the player attempts to close the popup a new one joins it - "This beta release of The Adventurers of Annwn require players to work in a Party. You have automatically assigned one." 

Cutting back to the Elders, you notice that a few other Characters have suddenly joined you and the Council. The Elder who mentioned the Party then pulls out a stone ([[Luminara Heartstones#Ethereal Echo Stone|Ethereal Echo Stone]]) from his pocket, raising it infront of him. Your mic icon suddenly glows and switches on, and an option appears in front of you. Give the stone to who? and a list of all your names appears. 

After the Party decides, the world opens up. If they check, they'll find a map - unexplored areas in shadow. Zooming out of the map - it's clear other parts of the world are explorable. A Quest appears on the screen for everyone 

"Find the [[Luminara Heartstones]]:
- ~~Ethereal Echo Stone~~
- Luminous Prism
- Harmonic Compass"

And Ethereal Echo Stone gets a big animated tick next to it and is crossed out.
