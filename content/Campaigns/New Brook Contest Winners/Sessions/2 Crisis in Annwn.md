After selecting the game and hitting "Start Game," a loading screen momentarily occupies your vision. As it fades, you find yourselves staring at the title, "The Adventurers of Annwn," with a single option: "Start Game." With a shared sense of anticipation, you confirm your readiness and venture into the character designer interface. Here, each of you can craft your unique in-game appearance, taking time to decide how your characters will look.

>*Tell me, what does your character look like? The options seem to be an amalgamation of standard Fantasy tropes, mashed together with things inspired by the Super Mario franchise. The initial selection includes:
>Elves
>Dwarves
>Humans
>Toads
>Kongs
>Yoshisaurs
>(Maybe Tostarenans, Lochladies, Steam Gardeners, Shiverians, Koopas, Shy Guys, Turtles)*

As you finalize your character's look, you're prompted to choose a screen name, marking the completion of your character creation. 

> *Go ahead and place your screen name on your character sheet. You can reveal it by scratching out the very left-most section at the very top of your character sheet.*

A moment of excitement fills the virtual air. However, something unexpected occursâ€” your field of vision abruptly goes dark, plunging you into a void of obscurity. You attempt to communicate, only to discover that your microphones are mysteriously muted. It's a bewildering start to the game, leaving you all feeling disoriented and disconnected. 

>*If players attempt to pull up any HUDs, they are met with a settings panel, an "Actions Guide" and a map. The Map is dark*.

As you push forward with your controls your virtual surroundings shift, resembling a surreal, Mushroom Kingdom-like environment. Slowly but surely, you begin to understand that you're in the game's tutorial section, there are no real dangers here, just a beautiful forest, the occasional mushroom that allows for a squishy high jump. The area takes you through the basic movement controls, and ends with you seeing a Toad in the distance, but in your way stands a [[Goomba]], what do you do?

> *As you start this unusual tutorial section, how do you react to the sudden darkness and the muted microphones? Do try to call out to family members or friends in the room for assistance? Look for a handout? 
> 
> Depending on what they do, players may reveals some of their Stats, probably [[Tilt]] and [[Build]]. If they expose System, a game patch comes on to the screen, and they need to install the latest version of the game - change System to Build.*

At the end of the path, you encounter the Toad. He's got a large backpack on, and is setting up a campfire. 

> *Everyone exposes [[Meta]] at this point, to see if they recognise the Toad.*

As you approach, it calls out to you, asking if you'd like to sit down to his fire. After you do so, your character reveals to the Toad that you've lost your memory, and have no idea what's going on! The Toad seems to take this in its stride, informing you that you were probably hurt when Bowser attacked... and with that the screen fades to black, replaced by a cinematic. The Cinematic depicts Bowser's menacing airships descending upon the realm of [[Campaigns/New Brook Contest Winners/Adventurers of Annwn/Annwn/Luminara]] which you can see is a vast land on a larger world. Most of it is obscured by clouds. The airships come from off screen, piloting down to the ground, and releasing chaos and devastation. Koopas jump off their ships into a plethora of landscapes, you catch a glimpse of glowing caves, a snowy mountain, even an island glittering in the sunlight. Suddenly the camera cuts to a creature you've not seen before. The game labels it as the [[Silken Sprite]] - its form shimmers with a delicate cascade of threads, akin to silken tendrils spun from the light of distant stars. It's part angel, part game sprite, part humanoid. Suddenly, Bowser himself lands behind the Sprite, who seemed to be sleeping, and you see him and a large group of [[Magikoopa]]s surprise the Sprite - capturing it in a magical web. Before the scene ends though you witness the Sprite release what looks to be three shining artefacts - each zooming off into different directions.

> *As the cinematic unfolds, how do you feel witnessing Bowser's airships wreaking havoc?

As the cinematic concludes, the Toad urges you to embark on a journey to the local village, where Village Elders are convening to decide on the next course of action. The game shows your character walking down the road, a village in the distance, and a prompt appears on the screen, asking you to decide on a "Class"

>*Show Class options here.*
