- There's a local paper that doesn't the like the Factory, called [[Sun Sprout Times]] - the editor is very sour/bleak [[John Jameson]]. Every Sunday he publishes his own poetry in the papers.

Start with Frank being visited by [[John Jameson]]. He got an anonymous tip that [[Frank]] received a console, so he decides to check it out. [[John Jameson]] has also been looking into the Factory.

[[Lolita]] and [[Theo]] are both still being questioned by Janice the secretary.
[[Ned]] and [[Silver]] are both attempting to infiltrate the Factory, and have just come upon the workers.

Frank and [[John Jameson]] will arrive at the Factory just as the alarms start to go off.

Janice is not perturbed at all. 
The reason the lady (a woman named Susan) is so upset is because she hates the cleaning robots
The "cameras" above the workers are just temperature gauges

Information to uncover:
- Morse Chocolates has been using chemically altered beans that can cause high levels of addiction - but alters the brain so that individuals actively ignore it. Most people in town are addicted.
- [[Cora Morse]] is the factory manager, and the son is [[Marshmallow Morse]]. Both are in the Factory right now. 
- NexLink doesn't actually care, they just want advertising space.
