In front of you is a path, and the game won't allow you to exit it. It leads down to the village.

Part way down, the game suddenly cuts to a cinematic, as kid-[[Mario]] and kid-[[Luigi]] are fighting over some mushrooms and running away from a few [[Koopa Troopa]]s. The duo crash into you, the mushrooms go flying - and suddenly, just like that you're in a fight with the [[Koopa Troopa]] with Mario and Luigi at your side. What do you do?

>- [[Meta]] - You know that the Koopa Troppa will just attack the brothers, and vice versa - and neither really do any real damage it seems.
>- [[Hands]] - You find you're able to jump onto the Koopa and have him spin off
>- [[Build]] - You can do a spinning attack which has the Koopa spin off
>- [[Presence]] - tells you that the mushrooms that the Duo were holding are simple power ups - they'll ad +1 to a stat of choice.
