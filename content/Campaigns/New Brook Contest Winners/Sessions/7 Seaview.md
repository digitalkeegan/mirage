Welcome back Travellers of Annwn! After logging back into the Adventurers of Annwn, the scene is suddenly altered once someone tries interacting with anything at all in the game. The game crashes, and then reboots. Players find themselves no longer on the [[Aurora Peaks]], but rather in a new place on in Luminara - [[Seaview]].

Seaview is a picturesque coastal town nestled between rolling hills and the Sapphire Ocean, exudes a serene charm that belies its ominous underbelly. Quaint cottages with white picket fences line cobblestone streets, and you get the feeling that, were you able to smell anything, the salty sea breeze would be carrying the scent of fresh catch from the harbour. 

As you make your way through the town though, you notice that lurking beneath this idyllic facade is a haunting mist that perpetually shrouds the town's eastern sections - through the mist you can see a large building, of some sort, rests at the heart of this creepy part of town. 

> Anytime players talk to an NPC, the NPC makes sure to mention "The Factory" and the fact that most of the townsfolk work there. There is a palpable air of unease, all hinting at a darker reality concealed behind the scenic vistas.

Three Quests seem to be in the area, on at the docks, the other is in the local pub, and the other is at the center of town. The moment a player attempts to find out more about any of the Quests, or if they attempt to trigger a Quest to start, the game suddenly flickers around them, the Quests grey out, and a single, new, Quest becomes available - right at the heart of the dark part of town. 

Notable points: In the pub, they only sell hot chocolate. The town's fountain doesn't have water, but some brown liquid.
#### Outside the Factory

As the players get closer to that part of town, it becomes clear that the mists cover what looks to be a factory of some sort.

Outside the factory there are NPCs working the ground with an assortment of items, axes, brooms, swords, and even just their arms . It is not exactly clear what they're doing, but if triggered, they all reply with an assortment of responses that seem to indicate that they should actually be in some other place:

> "What a lovely day to go out fishing, why not join me Adventurer!"
> "Adventurer, my sheep have run amok, can you help me find them, them, them, them, dgasugdad"
> "The sun is out and shining today, I wish I could get out of class and go play!"

The main Quest trigger seems to be found inside the Factory itself.

#### Inside the Factory

The Factory inside seems to confirm it really it some sort of industrial work - depending on the "Meta" ability roll of a player they grow more aware of how odd the environment really is - it's a random collection of different game assets. Part of factory is mining crystals, all the NPCs there are miners and when triggered talk about how good it is to work in the Crystal Caverns - even if hard work. Other parts of the Factory seem to be a grouping of different blacksmith shops - all the NPCs offer to sell "their wares" but don't have anything to sell. 

One of the NPCs that is carrying crystals from one part of the room to another is where the Quest trigger is found. 

> " Greetings Adventurer! My name is Esrom! I desperately need your help. As you can see, my friends and I have a great job here in Seaview, but it's not without its dangers! Below our beloved workplace is a sinister monster that is causes some of us some distress. Please vanquish the monster for us!" 

The Quest location shifts on the map to a location below the Factory itself. When the players arrive, a massive spectre appears and confronts the party. This ghostly entity takes on the form of a factory worker's silhouette, with chains draped across the form, which it uses to attack the party.

After defeating the party, the creature explodes leaving behind a single item - a piece of paper that has the sentence "Check the Ingredients" on it. The paper errors out once placed in the item bag though, and the players are forced to logout when the game freezes.
