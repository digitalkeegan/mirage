Summary:

Bowser's menacing airships have descended upon the tranquil realms of Luminara and Annwn, heralding chaos and destruction! As you all jumped into the game, you found yourselves within the Luminaire Woods. Soon after arriving, you were unexpectedly joined by kid versions of Mario and Luigi, who escorted you to the Village Elders at the heart of Luminaire. The elders soon explain the gravity of the situation - learning about Bowser's nefarious plans to merge the two worlds, his kidnapping of the [[Silken Sprite]] and the need to find the [[Luminara Heartstones]]. By the time the meeting has finished, you find yourselves thrust into a party, and in possession of the [[Luminara Heartstones#Ethereal Echo Stone|Ethereal Echo Stone]].

## Exploring the Woods

The Players might begin by exploring Luminaire (the town) or the [[Luminaire Woods]], if so, use that page to show off the various side-quests.

Otherwise, players seeing the map in their inventory will note that that the [[Aurora Peaks]] are highlighted as the location for their current Quest to find the [[Luminara Heartstones]].

## Travelling to the [[Aurora Peaks]]

Travelling to the Peaks will require crossing the mountain range to the east of the Woods, then crossing a strait.

*A note of Fast Travel, players can Fast Travel to locations they've been, but it costs gold*

Crossing the Mountains will require a d20+5 Contest for each player to see how well they manage through the environment. They also encounter a [[Koopa Troopa]] each and at the end of the travel a [[Crystal Golem]]

Crossing the Strait will require something special, they can't swim it, if they go too far out, a massive shark appears in a cut-scene and they re-spawn by the rest on the shore.
