Session 0 is all about world building, and character creation. Today, you'll be building out the character you'll play throughout the campaign, as well as some general world building.

First some 
# Boundary Setting though. 
Everyone has already filled out their consent form, thank you for that. Collating those has resulted in a few veils and lines. For your info, a veil is something we'll just gloss over, it's not something that has to be excluded, but we won't detail it or describe it. Often I'll just "fade to black" these, but these can also be alluded to, or be present through subtext. A line is something we'll avoid completely, it just won't come up, and I realise the fact, I'll immediately change the direction we're going on. If I don't I'd like to encourage you to speak up.

Our current veils are:
Sex
Homophobia, Sexism, and Racism
Harm to Animals
Claustrophobia
Cancer
Gore
Animal Harm
Self-harm

And Lines are:
Romances between the actual Player Characters
Explicit harm to minors
Sexual assault
Torture
Abortion
Child Kidnappings

Because we're playing as minors in this game, and because of those veils, this means that we'll never get into explicit harm to player characters while you're playing as your kids. Which means we have to cover how combat will be dealt with very early on. In this game, there are no hit points - but none of you are immortal. Actually, compared to the forces you might come in contact with, you’re exceptionally fragile. A well-aimed bullet from a government agent, the quick flick of a monster’s jaws, or a punch from a bully that goes to far could end things in a moment. We'll get into actual combat rules when we hit our first fight, but it's just good to know that fighting is something that most of the kids will want to avoid at all costs, and even hot-under-the-collar preteens will regret once the first blow lands. 

All that said, please be sure to respect your friends’ boundaries while playing to make sure everyone enjoys their experience.

***Any Questions?***

# Tone

I can already tell you now that the tone of the game is going to tend on the humourous side, I won't be taking us in the actual-horror direction.

# Town Creation

We're not actually going to spend as much time in Town Creation as you might expect. For now, we're going to take turns just filling out some basic info:

First up, everyone roll one d20 - the winner gets to have the final say in the town's name, but let's hear ideas from everyone.

(If we have time later we can do all of the [[Town Creation Questions]]. Otherwise for now, going clockwise...

[[New Brook]]

- Our adventure takes place in (name of town and state) - USA, TN
- Our school is called - Abbot Elementary and High-school 
- The industry our location is best known for is, Chocolate Creation, Morse Chocolates - not a good place to work, Low pay and long hours
- Our town is famous for - Chocolate Festival every year, and they're export chocolate cats (instead of Easter bunnies) - happens in the Spring. 
- Our town is infamous for - last year three people died in the Morse Chocolate factory, but the factory covered it up. Blamed on worker negligence, Gordie Smalls was fired and lost his pension - he was the Shipping Supervisor, but he says that the son of the factory manager. [[Cora Morse]] is the factory manager, and the son is [[Marshmallow Morse]]. 
- Economically, our town is (prosperous, floundering stagnant, etc.), the Town is prospering, but definite class define along the train tracks. 
- Our school's sports team is called - The Human Beans - The Mascot is just a person, and just carries beans. The Rivals are called the Unicorns - Football. 
- Used to grow green beans before the chocolate factory. 
- The school is on an old farm, Abbot Farm, that used to grow beans. 
- There's a local paper that doesn't the like the Factory, called Sun Sprout Times - the editor is very sour/bleak [[John Jameson]]. Every Sunday he publishes own poetry. 

# Character Creation
We will now look at our characters. First of all, pull out your character sheets. I want you to put down your name and age for now, remember if you've picked teen I've asked you to play a younger one.

You've probably already chosen a Trope, if you've not, do so now from the [[KoB Playbook.pdf]]

Under Stats, you're going to put down a D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and a D20 in each of those slots. The higher the number, the better you are at that thing. 
[[Brains]],[[Brawn]],[[Charm]],[[Fight]],[[Flight]],[[Grit]]

If you're a Kid, add a +1 to Flight and Charm, and if you're a Teen add it to Fight and Brawn. 

You'll need two Strengths ticked, if you started with a Trope, one will already be selected, but you need to select a second. 

![[Strength Descriptions]]

This also applies to Flaws - go ahead and make sure two are ticked or are in the Flaws field (depending on the kind of Character sheet you have). When I have the details for these, I'll share them, but they seem self-explanatory.

In addition to being ways to describe your character, these Strengths are ways that you can use Adversity Tokens. You’ll start with three Adversity Tokens and earn one whenever you fail a stat check or lose in combat. Throughout the game, as you accumulate Adversity Tokens, you can spend them to activate your Strengths, as described in [[Strength Descriptions]]

## Introductions

In this campaign, all of you know at least of each other, attend the same school - but that doesn’t mean you all like each other all that much. Spend a few minutes discussing *how* your characters know each other. It might be that you know someone well - like, best-friend well - or it might be that you barely know them at all - like passed-in-the-halls barely. But it’s a small town.
You certainly all know each other by name. Even if one of you is a new kid in town, word spreads fast. Not a lot of people move to [[New Brook]]. Usually, it’s the opposite.

We're going to work on this all together by answering questions about one another. So, starting with someone who wins a d20 roll off...

The person to your left, you'll either decide that you
- Don't know them
- Know them...
	- and will answer a Positive Question about them
	- or answer a Negative Question about them

Roll a d20 and answer the corresponding question from [[Relationship Questions]] (If the question doesn’t fit your relationship with that character or if the question you roll has already been answered, you may answer a question above or below the one you rolled that hasn’t been answered yet or re-roll.) Then, cross out that question.

Then, move the person who was just the focus of the conversation will do the same thing with the original person - with a change. If the original Question was a Positive one, this needs to be a Negative (and vice versa). If they decided they didn't know you, then you also roll on that same table. 

## Finishing Touches

Now, we’ll add the last details about your character and get started! You’ll find places for all of these details on your Trope sheets, so write them in there. 
### Motivation:
Write down something that strongly motivates you. It might not be the thing that drives all of your decisions, but it should certainly drive most of them - and especially their big decisions. It could be a specific motivation (e.g., “impress Tom so that he’ll go out with me” or “get back at Jessica for what she did to me in 6th grade”), it could be more general (e.g., “look cool” or “learn”), or it could have to do with concealing some information (e.g., “don’t let everyone know I’m terrified of the dark” or “don’t let anyone know I’m the thief in town”). If appropriate, share these with other players - but most likely, you’ll just be sharing this motivation with the GM.

### Fears:
Think about what it is that scares you. There will be some mechanical implications for this fear that will be addressed in “[[Planned Actions]] and [[Snap Decisions]]”, which we’ll talk about when we first roll dice. More broadly, though, you will, of course, want to avoid your fears, and when faced with them, you’ll behave more irrationally when facing that fear. Ultimately, what you fear in the game is up to you. Children usually fear things that, rationally, they shouldn’t fear - and don’t fear things that they ought to. They’re more likely to walk up to a stranger covered in blood to make sure they’re okay than they are to open up their closets in the middle of the night. Generally, children fear the unknown and what they can’t see. Kids are also generally not ashamed of their fears; they’ll gladly declare them to friends and strangers alike. 

### Backpack:
Indicate what you have in your backpack, literally and figuratively. Literally speaking, what items are you never without? For kids, these might literally be in their backpack. What would make the most sense for you. For example, a good Scout would never be caught without their pocketknife - except at school, of course. Figuratively speaking, the backpack is also a good place to list advantages that you have over other people. While this doesn’t have to consider all of the ways in which you are privileged, it would be a good place to think about the more intangible resources you have at your disposal. For example, Azra’s backpack might indicate that her parents are exceptionally supportive and do everything they can to give her the resources to succeed at school. Tom’s backpack, on the other hand, might indicate that his bad relationship with his parents has given him a strong sense of self-reliance and ability to do for himself. The intangible resources in your backpack won’t have a mechanical impact on the game, but they should give you places to turn if you need help in getting out of a problem - or create tension if that resource is suddenly not available. 

### Trope-Specific Questions: 
Finally, each Trope sheet in the playbook has two questions about your character. Now that you have a good sense of your character, use these two questions to put on the finishing touches! The answers to these questions do not need to be shared with the other players at the table - but they could be if you would like to. Certainly, though, your responses should be shared with the GM.
