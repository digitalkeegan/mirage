In the tapestry of existence, there are rare souls known as Weavers (sometimes called Wind Walkers, Fate Pullers, Fate Shapers, "رنين" (ranīn), or Fatewrights), individuals touched by the divine hand of [[El]]. These unwitting shapers of fate hold within them the ethereal threads of destiny, subtly influencing the course of lives around them. Like knots in the cosmic fabric, they unravel and re-weave the patterns of destiny without conscious intent. These individuals are conduits through which the Creator God subtly corrects the course of history, orchestrating the symphony of destinies with awe-inspiring authority, sometimes, if not often, oblivious to their role in the cosmic design.
