[[El]] formed and created [[The Universe]] and infused the [[Wind Everlasting]] at its very being. He created men and elves to dwell within [[The Universe]], to populate it and rule alongside the [[El-nur]]. The El-nur also created beings to dwell in the realm; [[Makroth]] created the dwarfs, so he had creatures that he could teach and raise up. 
  
When the council sundered in two and the Nahash deceived some of the El-nur, they twisted at creation and so corrupted the hearts of those that had been created. The El-nur that followed the [[The Nahash]] also sought to design their own creations, but without the blessings of the Wind Everlasting, they were forced to corrupt and change those that had already been made.

Since [[The Sundering]], the El-nur and [[The Shadows]] have either shaped or corrupted, respectfully, what El has made, forming what we know as [[The Universe]], which incorporates the:
- [[Material Plane]] (this is where most people exist and live, and many know nothing else) 
- [[The Dream Realm]]
- [[The Windy Shores]]
- [[The Dark]]


> [!danger] We need:
> -   The place where mortal spirits go after death, which might include any or all of the first three
> - A way for spells and monsters that use the Astral Plane and the Ethereal Plane to function
