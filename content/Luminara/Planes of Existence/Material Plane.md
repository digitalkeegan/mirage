Throughout [[The Universe]], the cosmos, there lies many worlds in which the Wind Everlasting has been found. Some worlds know far more about the Wind Everlasting and the El-nur, but in most (if not all) worlds those events that occurred at the dawn of creation are now only found in myth and legend. 

Each world, so divergent from the rest, remember the El-nur differently, the original names and events lost in time. In some worlds, the Wind is found all around, expressed through magic or other seemingly divine powers. In other worlds, the Wind has long been forgotten, and so exists only has the life-force that drives sentience.  
  
In some worlds, the people remember their place as custodians, rulers, and caretakers of creation, whereas in others, they do not, and their realm has slipped into darkness. The effects of The Nahash, always at work in his attempts at destruction can be found aplenty, whether subtly in hearts twisted by malice or in the grandiose, the wholesale destruction of worlds.

Worlds that are tracked are called a [[Realms of Arva]]
