The Windy Shores exists as an unmeasured island that is surrounded by [[The Dark]]. This is where it is said the [[El-nur]] exist when not in relationship with the rest of creation. Sometimes called "The Great White",  The Timeless Halls, Valhalla.

It is essentially cut off from the rest of creation, allowing only the [[El-nur]] and a select few to have access to it. Those within The Dark could conceivably gain access as well, but this doesn't seem possible as of now.
