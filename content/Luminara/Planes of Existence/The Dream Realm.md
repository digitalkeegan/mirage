The Dreamworld, the Panpai, the Sleeping Realm, the Astral Plane, goes by many different names. It is a plane of existence that exists in parallel to that of the physical. On some worlds access to this plane is known, or even common, in others it has been forgotten, or the El-nur never even made it known.
