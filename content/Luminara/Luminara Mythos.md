[[El]] is the supreme being of the universe, creator of all existence. He is “The One”, “The Primary”, “The Name”, “The Creator”, “The Mother”, and countless other known and unknown names throughout the cosmos.  
  
El first created the [[El-nur]], witnesses to El’s creative efforts, and intended future rulers over creation. El alone though is the great animator of life, by giving it the [[Wind Everlasting]]. Creatures that were not created by El directly still needed the acceptance of El for that life to be free.  

El creates [[The Universe]]
  
The first of the El-nur, Shahar, the Son of the Dawn, desired to wield the Wind Everlasting. He sought to create and control things of his own, without the help of El or the El-nur. El denies him the ability to wield the Wind Everlasting, and so Shahar rebels, defying the creative will of El and marking him out as the first evil, the first rebellion. And so Shahar is cast out, removed from the Great Council.  
  
The other El-nur, inspired by El’s teachings and seeking to carry out his wishes, but lacking in the ability to understand the evil and hatred that Shahar has wrapped about himself, attempts to release him to see him redeemed and returned to the council. 

But Shahar had grown bitter in his absence from the Council. El had sought him out and attempted to teach him, primarily that all creative acts ultimately come from him, all things that they devise or add to creation are simply explorations of the mind of El, and even those that they twist will eventually be turned back to glorify El.

And so when the El-nur sought out Shahar he wrapped about them malice and pride, offence at not being told all secrets and all knowledge. Shahar becomes [[The Nahash]], the liar, and seeks only to destroy creation forgetting his prior desires of control, rule, and creation.  

He leads some members of the council in rebellion, and they leave [[The Windy Shores]] to reside in creation, or what will eventually become [[The Dark]] as they seek to corrupt and destroy. These corrupted El-nur come to be known as [[The Shadows]]. This event is called [[The Sundering]]
