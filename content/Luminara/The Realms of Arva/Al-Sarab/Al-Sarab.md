"عالم السراب" (Alam Al-Sarab), or Al-Sarab (السراب) translated as "World of Mirage," is a fantastical realm steeped in illusion and mystery. The landscape of this world is characterized by shifting sands, ethereal oases, and elusive cities that appear and disappear like mirages. The very fabric of reality in this realm is intertwined with enchanting illusions, challenging adventurers to distinguish between what is real and what is mere illusion.

# Legend and Myth

In the tapestry of Alam Al-Sarab's history, a legend echoes through the shifting sands, whispered by those who call this fantastical realm home. According to their tales, the world itself was born from the dreams of an ancient celestial being - its destiny forever entwined with the elusive quest for truth amidst the dance of reality and illusion. The legends speak of individuals who, by mastering the art of perception, can unlock the secrets hidden within the mirages and gain access to unparalleled knowledge and power.

Yet, even through the world's mirages, remnants of an enigmatic past sprawl across the world's landscape. Massive, ancient ruins stand as silent witnesses to a forgotten era, a legacy of the elusive [[First Worshippers]], shrouded in mystery. The echoes of their advanced technologies and profound wisdom reverberate through the annals of time.

Now, factions race against each other, driven by an insatiable thirst for technological and cultural supremacy. Ruined cities, once mere curiosities for intrepid adventurers, have transformed into coveted treasure troves of lost wisdom, sought after not only by the curious but by entire factions hungry for ancient knowledge.

> [!info] Ancient Movers
> Amidst the shifting magic of the world, some ancient constructs stir to life once more. Golems and war machines, relics of a bygone era, roam the ever-changing landscape. Some wreak havoc, while others stand as guardians, protectors of the ancient knowledge embedded within their metallic sinews.

The rediscovered artefacts and ruins have become objects of cultural reverence, sparking the formation of cults, scholarly pursuits, and political alliances among factions. Symbols and teachings of the ancient civilization are interpreted in diverse ways, shaping the beliefs of those who seek to grasp the mysteries left behind.

Some of Al-Sarab's settlements, cognisant of the historical significance of theses ruins, have begun to forge agreements to safeguard the ancient creations as cultural heritage sites. Specialised organisations have even emerged - dedicating their efforts to preservation, employing advanced magical wards to shield against environmental threats, looting, and unauthorised alterations. Preservation has become a collective priority in these settlements, with different cities contributing resources to ensure the enduring legacy of these historical landmarks amidst the ever-shifting geography of Alam Al-Sarab.

# Geography and Crystals

The geography of Al-Sarab is defined by *perpetual movement*. Across the world, the landscape is in constant flux—sand dunes transform into breathtaking vistas, rivers alter their courses along with the settlements that line their banks, mountains shift in a graceful dance, and jungles emerge from snowy fields. Cities, the bastions of stability, harness ancient crystals infused with magic to counteract the ever-changing surroundings. While these crystals exist in various sizes, those large enough to support an entire city's foundation are exceedingly rare.

> [!info] The Solar Crystal
> The [Solar Crystal]([[Realms of Arva - Unknown History]]) acts as the 'sun' in the Al-Sarabi system. Days are are 24 hours long as Al-Sarab rotates about its axis. Al-Sarabi is actually quite close to the crystal, which is most likely the cause for Al-Sarab's extreme magical anomalies.  Included in the Al-Sarabi system are the two moons [[Zahrat]] (Blossom) and [[Aswadnar]] (the Black Fire)

It was early in their struggle for survival that humans turned to the larger crystals for security, unlocking the secrets to their power through a delicate dance of knowledge passed down through generations. These geo-stabilities, usually called "anchors," became essential to humanity's growth, providing havens for settlement. The selection of these anchors was driven by considerations such as size, their proximity to resources, and access to fresh water. Finally, as stability was finally possible, progress brought forth emerging trade routes, hampered only by the unpredictable shifts in the realm's topography. Bloodlines, driven by sheer determination or technological prowess, amassed wealth by navigating these perilous routes, engaging in trade that surpassed mere survival.

As the world's resources drifted and transformed, old settlements stood as silent witnesses to the ebb and flow of Al-Sarab's dynamism. A constant awareness pervaded the populace, acknowledging that settlement longevity was an elusive endeavour. Some communities embraced a nomadic existence, eschewing permanence to dance with the ever-changing landscapes. Others undertook daring feats, physically uprooting their settlements to traverse the sands in search of new havens.

While the power of the larger crystals remained an enigma for millennia, humans eventually found ways to utilise even the smaller shards, serving myriad purposes. These mystical gems illuminated darkness, powered pumps drawing water from the depths, and helped hone magical endeavours - becoming the lifeblood of civilisations. Apart from creating anchors for stability in the tumultuous sea of ever-shifting terrains, people discovered creative uses for the crystals. Ambitiously, they propelled simple flying crafts into the sky - a privilege reserved for the elite. Unpredictable in the higher atmospheres, prone to catastrophic failure, and deemed absurd by the everyday person, these new machines marked a significant step for humanity in taming the wilds. Yet, they introduced a world of danger and opportunity. Above, in the rarefied air of higher altitudes, floating archipelagos emerged as celestial beacons. Navigational wonders, they shaped the skies into a strategic chessboard for air travel. Pilots, weaving through these floating landmasses, added an extra layer of complexity to their journeys, turning each flight into a daring venture into the unknown currents of Al-Sarab's aerial realms.

> [!Info] Mirages
>  From shifting deserts to lush oasis realms and ethereal mountains crowned with crystalline glaciers, every corner of Alam Al-Sarab is steeped in magic. The clearest, most spectacular evidence of this is Al-Sarab's Mirages. Although the geography of Alam Al-Sarab is in a constant state of flux, changes are usually measured by years. But Mirages, well, they are much different. With sand dunes morphing into humid forests one day, vanishing entirely the following day, and home to an snow storm the next Mirages are unpredictable and dangerous.


# Society
## Religion

Religion plays a large part in the daily life of those that call Al-Sarab home. While there are many different faiths practised in the world, by far most worship a single creator being. This being goes by a number of names, and the practices involved in worshipping them do differ greatly. Most call him [[Al-Khaliq]]. Legend states that Al-Khaliq created everything, including the Sun Crystal (sometimes called Al-Munir, An-Nur, or just the sun), as well as Al-Sarab and her two moons. It is commonly believed that magic flows from either Al-Khaliq or the Crystal itself, though there are many debates as to the specifics. 

Some worship the Sun Crystal itself as [[An-Nur]] (The Light) - they are usually of the opinion that Al-Khaliq and An-Nur are simply the same being. Although not many in number, some also worship [[Zahrat]] as part of a polytheistic faith, while it's whispered that there are darker worshippers that look to [[Aswadnar]] for power and favours. 

There are also though that worship the First Worshippers, believing that a civilisation that created such wonders could not have simply perished - instead having risen to the heavens, and would one day return. They call themselves the [[Second Worshippers]].

## Honour

Honour is, by far, the greatest of all social currencies in Al-Sarab. Honur is the golden thread that weaves through the fabric of one's existence. It is the unseen light that illuminates the path of righteousness, a luminous jewel nestled in the heart's sanctum. Honour is the echo of noble deeds resonating through time, a melody sung by the virtuous winds of tradition and righteousness. It is the sentinel of integrity, standing guard against the encroaching shadows of deceit. Like the sun crystal casting its unwavering gaze upon the vast expanse, honour is an unyielding force, guiding souls through the shifting sands of life with grace and steadfastness. It is the sacred covenant between the self and the divine, an eternal flame burning bright in the sanctified chambers of the soul. As such, the people of Al-Sarab seek every opportunity to gift, display, and bestow honour on each other - with large banquets being the epitome of societal acclaim. These events, pivotal for individual and familial standing, transcend mere gatherings—they are theaters of opulence, a display of status adorned in resplendent attire, shimmering jewelry, and the finest vestiges of social standing. It is a realm where public displays become a currency, contributing to the cherished reputation of a family.

> [!info] Banquets in the Sand
> Beneath shimmering stars, ceremonies unfold in Al-Sarab's enchanting nights. The two radiant moons oversee the opulent affair, where silk canopies sway to celestial tunes. Guests, draped in vibrant robes, share laughter amid feasts of exotic delights. Dignitaries weave eloquent speeches, each gesture a stroke on honour's canvas. The night becomes a ballet as magic weaves between those that attend a night they wish would never end. 

Yet, in this realm of light, shadows are most certainly cast. Shame, a formidable tool of social correction, manifests in rituals ranging from community gatherings to symbolic acts of penance. The ever-looming fear of shame acts as a silent enforcer, a guardian of societal norms, ensuring conformity to cultural expectations.

In the crucible of disputes, extremes give rise to honour duels—a public theatre of integrity. Governed by strict rules, these duels become a testament to one's virtue. Triumph in a duel elevates honour to new heights, while refusal or defeat plunges the combatant into the abyss of public shame. Skilled duelists, their names etched in the annals of esteem, navigate this delicate dance, where each movement is a declaration of integrity in the face of honour's relentless gaze. In Al-Sarab, where faith and honour converge, every step is a dance between light and shadow, a delicate balance in the ever-shifting sands of destiny.

## Ancient Bloodlines

Many diverse beings inhabit the mystical realms of Al-Sarab, ranging from ordinary humans to legendary abominations. Most people in Al-Sarab are human, and although family history will play a part in their social standing, they are commonly believed to be created equal in the eyes of Al-Khaliq. Occasionally, though, ancient bloodlines may appear again, resulting in part-jinn - humans that clearly show features that have come from behind the veil. These people are very uncommon, and their standing shifts from settlement to settlement. At times, these bloodlines have sought solidarity amongst each other, striking out into the wilds and forming communities together - thereby increasing the likelihood of their unique physiologies from occurring and making communities of part-jinn possible. 

### Majidjinn
The most common part-jinn are the Majidjinn. Majidjinn features vary, but many will have metallic eyes, pointed ears, runes etched into the skin on their arms, or tattoos that shift over the course of their lives. Majidjinn are common enough that small communities are found throughout Al-Sarab. 

### Nurian
In contrast to the Majidjin, the Nurian and Anukari stand as exceedingly rare figures, capturing attention wherever they tread. Nurians will often have feathers that grow atop their head in place of hair, the colour of which can vary greatly, from pitch black to a copper that shines in the sun. 

### Anukari
Anukari in particular will often not be welcomed in "normal" society. Those with Anukari lineage might hope for nothing more than prominent canine teeth, but most are born with jackal-like features from the waist up, including a canid head and longer more powerful arms. 

> [!info] Hidden Cities
> Hidden within the mirages are ancient and magical cities, accessible only to those who can navigate the illusionary nature of their surroundings. Hidden cities serve as bastions of refuge and knowledge within Alam Al-Sarab. These elusive sanctuaries, protected by ancient enchantments, are not only places of safety but also hubs for cooperation among the realm's diverse inhabitants. 


# Magic

Magic is a natural part of life in Al-Sarab. For most people, magic is simply the catch-all term for the work that happens behind the veil of the world - the mystical, the immaterial forces, and sometimes even the divine. More than anything though, magic is the unexplained, a power beyond normal humans.

The relationship between magic and the various faiths in Al-Sarab hasn't always been smooth, and even though most simply accept the fact that mortals work with magic there are still many that see it as infringing on the divine's domain. To this end, some of the more extreme orders actually avoid cities that make use of magic to stabilise, or move-at-will, their locations. One well-known example of these communities are the [[Spires|Spire Sufis]] (or simply [[Spires]]). This monastic-like community makes use of a large structure called the [[Crystal Spire]], which hasn't moved in known history. Zahrat worshippers are often found out in the wild and often choose to allow themselves to be swept up in changing landscapes rather than make use of the protective magic employed by larger settlements. 

> [!info] The First Worshippers Call
> Intrigued by the mystical practices of the First Worshippers, magic users embark on a quest to merge ancient arcane techniques with contemporary disciplines. This techno-magic fusion births innovative practices, blending the timeless wisdom of antiquity with the modern understanding of magic. Magical academies weave teachings inspired by the ancient constructs into their curricula, forging a bridge between eras.

As magic entwines with the very fabric of society, Disciplines have emerged as integral components of daily life. Awareness specialists vigilantly serve as town watchmen, healers seamlessly integrate magical clinics with conventional medicine, shapeshifters find purpose in both entertainment and espionage, elementalists lend their talents to agriculture and industry, and symbolists become sought-after consultants for various arcane purposes.

In most of the larger settlements, the arcane arts have transcended mere practice, evolving into formal apprenticeship programs that birth skilled practitioners. Young individuals with latent magical potential flock to specialized schools, ensuring that the elusive power is not confined to the privileged elite but disseminated across a broader spectrum of the population. In the truely large cities,these magic users have even united in multidisciplinary guilds, forging collaborative bonds that set ethical standards, share knowledge, and engage in community projects, thus becoming influential bodies that contribute to the societal well-being.

In sophisticated settlements, education intertwines magical proficiency with traditional subjects, fostering an understanding and respect for magical forces from an early age. Nations engage in magical diplomacy, where diplomats skilled in diverse magical disciplines contribute to international relations, crafting treaties enhanced with symbolic wards, collaborating on public health initiatives, and finding magical solutions to environmental challenges.

> [!info] Magic in the Family
> The sanctity of magical wisdom transcends generations, creating dynasties of magic practitioners within families. Children inherit their family's magical discipline, a sacred duty that preserves and evolves magical traditions over centuries. The transmission of magical wisdom becomes a revered legacy, an enduring thread that weaves through the very essence of Alam Al-Sarab's enchanting history.

# Magical Beings

## Jinn

Although generally invisible (existing in the spirit realm for the most part), jinn are able to appear in Al-Sarab and can often change their appearance at will. Jinn do not usually meddle in human affairs, some believe there are many and that they just prefer to live with their own kind - others simply believe them to be few in number. Practically, the word Jinn can be used to describe *all* beings that live in the spiritual realm.

Jinn are usually neither good nor evil, just like humans. That said, just like humans, it is also clear that some have taken to evil wholeheartedly, seeking to tempt humans into violence. These come in many forms and are called many names, including Divs and Ifrit. Others seem to be significantly more benevolent, often called the Peri.

> [!important] The Spiritual realm in the Luminara
> What those who live in Al-Sarab call the "Spiritual Realm" is in fact [[The Dream Realm]]. This realm *is technically* accessible to humans, but those who live in Al-Sarab often just have no context for how this would fit into their worldview. Instead, those who come from "the other side" clearly do so to meddle in the "real" world. Few non-jinn ever come to Al-Sarab from the Dream Realm, and even when they have it was seen as myth or legend. Most who live in the Dream realm cannot even enter Al-Sarab - making the jinn who move between the realms all the more special. 

### Peri
Peris often appear as exquisite, winged spirits renowned for their beauty. Peris are often contrasted with evil divs.

> [!info] Peri in the Luminara
> 
> Peri are essentially those who used to work for and on behalf of [[Arva]], an [[El-nur]]. As such, they act as messengers and do the work of [[El]] indirectly. They all have access to [[The Dream Realm]] and Al-Sarab on the [[Material Plane]], and a very small select few can visit [[The Windy Shores]] if necessary. They carry the [[Wind Everlasting]].

### Divs 
Divs are a catch-all term for those jinn that are generally considered "evil", those that tempt humans into violence and trickery. Humans also use the term 'div' to describe beings they often don't understand, with all the negative connotations attached. 
#### Ifrit, Marid and Anuk
The jinn that cross from the spirit world into Al-Sarab come in many different shapes and sizes. The Ifrit are a type div and are seen as ruthless and wicked. Formed out of smoke and fire they seek to ensnare and cause harm to others. As the Ifrit are to fire, the Marid are to water. At home in the sea and river, these jinn are barely known to humans. Their stories are essentially myth now, and their continued existence is debated among scholars. On the other hand, the Anuk have clearly spent time with humans in the past. Their bloodlines occasionally resurface in what society usually calls the Anukari. Though the Anukari can sometimes be looked on with mixed emotions, the Anuk are most certainly reviled among humans after centuries of war with peris and humankind alike.

> [!info] Divs, ifrit, marids, and anuki in the Luminara
> Divs, ifrit, marids and anuki all belong to [[The Shadows]]. Followers of [[The Nahash]] they are clearly evil.

## Creatures and Monsters

The fauna of this world is as enchanting, strange, and dangerous as the world itself. With creatures that may appear as one thing but transform into another, blurring the lines between reality and illusion, the more deadly creatures of Al-Sarab deal in fear as much as they do pain. 

>[!todo]
> - [ ] Create more Monsters and Creatures. I small bestiary is needed.

### Simurgh
Scaled firebirds that the jinn are fond of riding if possible. The Simurgh are gigantic enough to carry off an elephant. It appears as a peacock with claws like a lion. The Simurgh is inherently benevolent and unambiguously female. The Simurgh has teeth. It has an enmity towards snakes, and its natural habitat is a place with plenty of water. 
### Rukh
Enormous predatory birds that the peri can use for hunting. Bloodthirsty creatures that will eat anything; they have an excellent sense of smell, making them great trackers. Easily the size of a shop with a wingspan as long as a street; they have ebony eyes, glittering blood-red feathers, and a long black beak with a sharply curved tip.
### Karkadann
A magical beast similar to an enormous rhinoceros with a horn as long as a man. Has scaly gray skin, yellow feet with three toes, and its horn juts straight from its forehead.
