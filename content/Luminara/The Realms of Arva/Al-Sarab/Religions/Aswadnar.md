Zahrat is one of the moons that orbits Al-Sarab, but is worshipped as well. Those who worship Aswadnar do so in secret - knowing that they are ultimately at odds with humanity, civilisation, and order. Dark Believers, as they are known, believe that Aswadnar was trapped by Zahrat long ago, but that Aswadnar is the true ruler of Al-Sarab. They believe that one day a true believer will rise up, ushering in an era whereby humanity accepts that they have strayed from the path, and turn back to the dark god - freeing Aswadnar and bringing about the remaking of Al-Sarab.
