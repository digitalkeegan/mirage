Zahrat is one of the moons that orbits Al-Sarab, and is worshipped as part of a polytheistic faith, primarily in [[Corallan]]. These people believe that Zahrat is the giver of all life, and long ago she brought life to Al-Sarab before returning to the heavens. When she did so, she left emissaries behind, to guide humanity to pursue goodness, honour, and faithfulness. These emissaries are worshipped in-of-themselves, and include The Wind, The Fire, The Sand 

### The Wind
The wind is often pictured with peri features but with feathers throughout the body, and often with avian facial features or even wings.

### The Fire
The Fire is not usually given an iconagraphic form, instead a flame is lit when worship is given. It is said that The Fire may have been at odds with the other emissaries, bringing fire to humans before Zahrat intended. 

### The Sand
The Sand is usually depicted as a woman in flowing robes - clean and without blemish looking up towards Zahrat.
