While there are many different faiths practised in the world, by far most worship a single creator being. This being goes by a number of names, and the practices involved in worshipping them do differ greatly. Most call him [[Al-Khaliq]]. Legend states that Al-Khaliq created everything, including the Sun Crystal (sometimes called Al-Munir, An-Nur, or just the sun), as well as Al-Sarab and her two moons. It is commonly believed that magic flows from either Al-Khaliq or the Crystal itself, though there are many debates as to the specifics. 

Worship of Al-Khaliq varies greatly across Al-Sarab, but is held strongly in [[Sarundar]] where massive temples of worship can be found. The Al-Khaliqi Priests parts of in [[Sarundar]] are particularly important - often politically powerful figures in their own right.
