[[Zepheria]] is well known for its mountainous region, and the people that live a life on the mountain peaks. Although most of the region is culturally [[Dari]], those that live on the mountains are [[Zephari]], and take pride in their cultural distinctiveness. This cultural difference extends to religious beliefs as well, with the [[Zephari]] worshiping [[Zahrat]] and her followers. It is thought by scholars that worship of [[Zahrat]] originated here.
