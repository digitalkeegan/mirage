## The world's Geographies change frequently, and without pattern
 
- Humanity struggles to grow and advance unless they find ways to mitigate, predict, or eliminate these effects.
	- Humanity likely finds "geo-stabilities" or "Anchors" to settle down in. Anchors that are larger, closer to fresh water, or closer to other resources are particularly important.
	- Humanity's ability to trade is hampered until safe passages form. 
	- Bloodlines that can make these trips, either by sheer force of will or by technological means, are rich due to being able to trade. 
- The world's resources likely drift. Fresh water ways change over time, peaceful or habitable zones become deadly, and vice versa.
	- Resulting in many old and unused settlements.
	- Humanity knows that eventually they will need to move on from their settlement or somehow move the settlement.
		- Some communities do just that, physically moving the settlement around.
		- Others simply don't settle down, instead living nomadically.
- Found in higher altitudes, floating Archipelagos can be found.
	- These archipelagos become crucial navigational points, creating a dynamic and strategic element in air travel. 
	- Pilots must plot courses around or through these floating landmasses, introducing an additional layer of complexity to air travel.

## Crystals, found throughout the world, hold power that can be used in various ways

- Humanity comes to rely on the crystals to create anchors fairly early on, but it takes time for them to advance in other ways enough to make use of the power emanating from the crystals.
	- Creating an anchor takes skill, but the knowledge is passed on and can be learnt. 
- Ways that crystals are used by humans:
	- Small ones can be used as light sources.
	- They can power pumps, like those used to pull water from deep wells.
	- To create anchors (Geo-stabilities).
	- They can power simple flying craft, allowing for air travel for the rich and powerful.
		- These can only go so far above ground before the crystals start interacting with the atmosphere, resulting in unpredictable behavior. This is not fully understood yet. 

## "Magic" exists, but to such an extent it's "normal" for most people. 

- Disciplines become integral aspects of daily life. Awareness specialists serve as town watchmen, healers run clinics alongside conventional medicine, shapeshifters find employment in entertainment or espionage, elementalists contribute to agriculture and industry, and symbolists become consultants for various purposes. Each discipline plays a recognized role in society.
- Formal apprenticeship programs emerge for each discipline. Young individuals with magical potential attend apprenticeship schools to specialize in a particular discipline. These programs provide a structured education, ensuring that magic is not only accessible to the elite but to a broader segment of the population.
	- Magic users organize into multidisciplinary guilds that promote collaboration between different disciplines. These guilds set standards for ethical magical practices, share knowledge across disciplines, and participate in community projects. The guilds become influential bodies that contribute to the well-being of society.
- In advanced settlements where schooling can occur, educational institutions incorporate magical proficiency as part of the standard curriculum. Students learn basic magical principles alongside traditional subjects. The emphasis on understanding and respecting magical forces becomes a cornerstone of education, fostering a harmonious coexistence between magic and mundane aspects of life.
- Nations engage in magical diplomacy, where skilled diplomats from different magical disciplines contribute to international relations. Symbolists craft treaties with magical wards, healers collaborate on public health initiatives, and elementalists find solutions for environmental challenges. Magic becomes a tool for fostering cooperation between settlements.
- Families pass down magical knowledge through generations, creating dynasties of magic practitioners. It becomes customary for children to inherit their family's magical discipline, preserving and evolving magical traditions over centuries. The transmission of wisdom becomes a sacred duty within magical lineages.

## Honour and Shame are the primary cultural commodities

- Grand ceremonies and rituals are conducted to honor individuals or families. These events are critical for social standing, and the more extravagant the ritual, the higher the status. Public displays of honor contribute to a family's reputation.
	- These events always include wonderful food, dancing, and people wearing their best clothes, jewelry, and other ways to show social standing. 
- Shame is used as a form of social correction. Those who violate cultural norms face public shaming rituals. This can range from community gatherings to symbolic acts of penance. The fear of shame keeps many in check, reinforcing societal norms.
- Disputes, when taken to the extreme, can often lead to honor duels. These duels, governed by strict rules, serve as a public demonstration of integrity. Winning a duel enhances one's honor, while refusing or losing can lead to public shame. Skilled duelists are highly esteemed.

## Those that currently call Al-Sarab are clearly not the first to do so, and humanity knows this. 

Throughout the world, large, ancient constructs can be found. Nobody really knows who the First Worshippers were, but it is clear they were considerably more advanced.

- The remnants of the ancient civilization include advanced technologies and knowledge. Rediscovering and deciphering these technologies has increased of late, as factions race against each other to gain a technological edge. Ruined cities are seen as treasure troves of lost wisdom - now to entire factions rather than just the curious adventurer.
- Some ancient constructs, like golems or war machines, are reactivated by the shifting magic of the world. These constructs wander the landscape, sometimes causing havoc, while others serve as protectors of ancient knowledge.
- The rediscovered artifacts and ruins become objects of cultural reverence. Factions interpret the ancient civilization's symbols and teachings in different ways, leading to the formation of cults, scholarly pursuits, and political alliances based on these ancient relics.
- Magic users, intrigued by the advanced mystical practices of the First Worshippers, seek to merge ancient magical techniques with contemporary disciplines. This techno-magic fusion results in the development of innovative magical practices, blending ancient wisdom with modern understanding. Magical academies incorporate teachings inspired by the ancient constructs into their curricula.
- Settlements sometimes manage to make agreements to protect ancient constructs as cultural heritage sites. Specialized organizations focus on the preservation of these locations, employing advanced magical wards to safeguard against environmental threats, looting, and unauthorized modifications. For some settlements, then, preservation efforts become a priority, with different settlements contributing resources to ensure the longevity of these historical landmarks.
