Al-Sarab is full of ancient wonders. Huge ruins can be found from the driest deserts to far below the waves of the seas. No one currently living in Al-Sarab knows the true origin of these ruins, but after generations of historians, archaeologists, and adventurers dedicating their lives to exploring them, a general consensus as arisen to give humanity a broad idea of what may have happened long ago. 

The Al-Sarabi call them the First Worshippers. Based on glyphs found on sites world-wide, it seems clear that those that created the grand structures of the past belonged to a single civilisation - or at least all spoke, or communicated, with the same language. For most of humanities history, the meaning of these glyphs remained hidden. Then, long ago, a man by the name of Farid Al-Hakim somehow worked out how to translate the language. How he managed this remains a contested argument between scholars, theologians, and historians. Regardless, the translation of what would become known as "Auric Script" was in fact useful, and since then the glyphs have been translated wherever possible.

With the secret of the Auric Script revealed, humans began to look to the ruins not only for places of shelter, but also as sources of information and wisdom. This wisdom would prove to be a turning point for those that call Al-Sarab home. By unravelling the secrets of the ancients, huge technological strides were made - everything from architecture, to engineering, to farming improved in the span of a generation. Possibly the most important advancement was when humanity worked out how to make use of Al-Sarabi crystals beyond the use of creating anchors. Truly, the opening of the ruins ushered in a golden age in the world.

It is well known that the ancients worshipped the Solar Crystal, with references to the crystal found throughout their civilisation, and often in places that seem to be places of worship.

> In the annals of Al-Sarab's history, the tale of Farid al-Hakim's unraveling of the language of the First Worshippers is shrouded in mystery and whispered with reverence. Legend speaks of a solitary figure, known only as the Desert Sage, who emerged from the shifting sands like a mirage, bearing the secrets of ages past.

>It is said that the Desert Sage dwelled in the heart of the desert, where time danced to the rhythm of the dunes and whispers of forgotten gods lingered in the wind. Some claim the Sage was a celestial emissary, a wanderer between worlds who communed with the spirits of antiquity. Others insist the Sage was but a humble nomad, touched by the hand of fate and blessed with ancestral knowledge.
>
Farid's encounter with the Desert Sage is steeped in the surreal tapestry of Al-Sarab's mythology. In the haze of a sandstorm, Farid stumbled upon an ancient oasis, its waters shimmering with ethereal light. There, beneath the canopy of a thousand stars, he found the Desert Sage, cloaked in robes of woven moonlight and crowned with the jewels of forgotten realms.
>
Through the veils of time and myth, the Desert Sage imparted unto Farid the language of the First Worshippers, a symphony of glyphs and echoes from a bygone era. Some say the Sage whispered incantations borne from the lips of deities, weaving spells of understanding into Farid's soul. Others claim the knowledge was bestowed upon Farid through the purity of his quest, a testament to the boundless depths of human curiosity.
>
As the sands of time continue to shift, the truth behind Farid's encounter with the Desert Sage remains veiled in ambiguity, a testament to the enigmatic nature of Al-Sarab's history. Yet, whether born of divine intervention or the wanderings of a humble nomad, the legacy of their meeting endures, illuminating the path of seekers who dare to unravel the mysteries of the ancient world.
