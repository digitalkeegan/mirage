# The World

## System

### The Material Plane:

Lok is one of three planets in the habitable zone of the ระบบสุริยะ (Rabsuriya) system. There are two other gas giants in the system, and an asteroid belt between the first planet, and Lok, the second. Lok has two moons, and they wax and wane separately from one another.

Lok is a planet with a wound, a great section of the planet is actually missing. Those who live on Lok call this section, “The Edge” as the waters that pour over the edge of the planet do so as if the world was flat. Although it is incredibly dangerous to sail near the edge, some have done it, and bring back tales of an empty Void that goes on forever, the stars particularly bright in the distance.  
Some of the sections that were once attached to the planet now float, fixed in place, above the great continent.

### The Dream (Astral/Ethereal) Plane:

The Dream Plane has been lost to the people of Lok for so long that it has been forgotten entirely. Only now, as the first Lodestone has been broken, have some found themselves on this plane when they sleep, though they do not know this is the case.


## Environment and Landscape

Lok is home to a single continent, also named Lok. The landscape varies from region to region and includes vast swaths of desert, mountain ranges, and forested areas. Along the southern edge of the continent, islands can be found dotting the ocean all the way to the equator. 

Throughout the lands of Lok large structures called Lodestones can be found. Lodestones are made of a material called Elsteel, a virtually indestructible material, that reflects the stars above, even in the middle of the day. So far, no one knows how Elsteel was made, or how the ancients ever managed to forge artefacts from it, as no one has found any way at all to break something made of Elsteel.  
  
The Lodestones found throughout Lok can be found throughout her varied landscapes. Many major cities on the continent are found surrounding Lodestones, and the effects of the stones, namely heightened magic use, are widely sought out. 

## Race and Ecology

Lok is home to both Elves and Humans. Because of its age though, Lok is also home to the following races in various amounts:

- Aarakocra
- Dragonborn
- Dwarfs
- Genasi
- Gnomes
- Goliaths
- Halflings
- Tieflings
- Aasimars

Lok is also home to an incredibly diverse ecology in almost all of its varied regions. Cities and nations have done their part in reducing the amount of flora and fauna in certain areas, but, with the help of the elves, the planet has come to a fairly established balance.  
  
It is said that the Genasi once came to the nations of Lok from over The Edge in an age long lost.

The Floating Isles, those massive floating islands off the coast of, and above, Northern Lok, are home to both Aarakocra, and other species that have found life on the mainland difficult. 

## Nations and Regions

In the Age of Legends, it is said that Lok was ruled by a collection of nations known as the Meuang Kingdom. Now, though, the kingdom has splintered into various Kingdoms that via for control.

## Society

Although cultures vary widely on Lok, there are a number of societal aspects that many of them share, one of which is the Great Game of Guilds. Guilds can be found throughout the planet, covering everything from adventuring, to blacksmiths, to postal services, to rat catchers. There are also many shadier guilds, such as the Thieves Guild and or Assassins Guild.  
  
Those that belong to the Guilds can increase in rank in that Guild by gaining renown. 

## Magic

The Wind Everlasting is found on Lok within her various races, but it is also expressed through magic. This magic is found within the planet itself, and so is found in abundance, and is quite accessible to those who spend time learning how to control it. Magic is socially acceptable, and those who study it are respected.  
  
Lodestones, in particular, seem to be magical foci that magnify magic use near the stones. Although they have been studied by magicians for as long as anyone can remember, no one yet knows why this is the case. The legends that surround the stones say that they hold the world together, that the forgotten gods once fought over Lok, and so the stones were made to keep the world from being torn in two. 

The larger Lodestones that contain Teleportation circles, are the most sought after, and usually this is where cities have been built if possible. Access to the sigils of these Teleportation circles are kept as a close secret, and usually only those belonging to the Wizards Guild


# The Story Up Till Now

The ancient kingdom of Meuang once ruled all of Lok

# Meta-Plot Timeline

## Plot Setup: Introduction to You

- One of the lodestones outside of a major city in AAA recently lost it’s channelling. Although nothing visible has happened to the stone, a wizard was sent from the city to investigate, but so far nothing has come of it.
- There are rumours abound of otherwise healthy people dying in their sleep.
- The two kingdoms of BBB and CCC have recently developed a truce in order to combat the emerging threat from DDD
- A king from EEE and queen from FFF have recently died

## Need and Drive

- The king of BBB has been killed, and his daughter has been raised to the thrown in the midst of anxiety and fear around who killed the king
- A lodestone has completely shattered in AAA and magicians and historians have been flocking to the area in an attempt to be the first to figure out what happened.
- Another Lodestone has been found with cracks in it.
- A Genasi has appeared in GGG (near the Edge), claiming that he has come from over the edge from a remnant kingdom built into the side of the planet. He claims that a prophecy has recently been fulfilled, and that doom has come to Lok. He was sent to the “surface world” to warn the peoples, and prepare them to “cross the void in salvation”. He claims a sickness will come that will cause all who ignore his warning to die.
- Magicians and historians are furiously working to figure out why one of the large floating islands has begun to slowly but surely drop. It is slow, a mere fraction of a distance a week, but it has been confirmed. The island seems to be vacillating, occasionally rising, and occasionally falling

## Time to Go

- The Kingdom of DDD has made headway in the war against BBB and CCC. The kingdom is lead by a king, but one that seems to be truly controlled by his advisor, a powerful sage that grew up with the king.
- Magicians have confirmed a link between the broken lodestone with an ancient tale of the stones being used to “protect” Lok. They fear that it is the stones that are somehow holding up the floating islands as well, and that if more break, the islands may fall.
- The Queen of EEE has recently been claiming to be able to visit a world in her dreams, giving more validity to those few who have been claiming to have similar dreams


## The Search

- A shadowy guild has made its way into the rumours of the land. It is said that they are responsible for the falling of the Lodestone, and for the falling of so many leaders
- Another lodestone has formed cracks. Researchers are paying more attention to the increase in vivid dreams, and seem to believe the Lodestones are causing the dreams.
- CCC has fallen to DDD. DDD claims to have forgotten knowledge about the Lodestones, and claim that the end of Lok is near. They say that unless they are able to bring stability to the various lands of Lok, resurrecting the ancient kingdom of Meuang, then all will be lost.
- The Genasi prophet has so far amassed a huge following in the kingdoms of EEE and FFF. They are flocking towards the Edge in anticipation of the end of Lok and their salvation. This has caused a massive refugee problem in GGG as they attempt to deal with the influx of people.

## The Fix

- Researchers have found that moving the broken pieces of the lodestone to the cracked one seems to stabilise the cracks. Halting their advance. Wizards suspect that this will also stabilise the vacillating floating island, but more research is needed.
- Someone has killed the powerful sage of DDD while using this new dream world. He never woke up, and the Queen of EEE has claimed responsibility 

## The Fall

- Those lodestones that had been thought to be fixed by the shattered one, have also shattered. Magicians the world over have lamented that a grave mistake has been made. That some sort of corruption was found in the broken pieces and now has spread to the other stones.
- All the floating islands have begun to fall from the sky. Slowly, but certainly.
- GGG is barely controlling their situation. The King of GGG has called out to other kingdoms for aid.
- Many people now find themselves gaining access to the new dreamworld. Some are claiming to be able to do feats usually unavailable to them, like jumping great distances and surviving falls that should have killed them. Many more are now dying in their sleep though, shadowy figures are said to be stalking the dimension killing both poor and rich alike.

## Stabilizing 

- The shadowy Guild called the XXX, has been revealed to the public in full. Rumour has it the advisor of DDD was a part of the group, and healers have since healed the king of DDD who claims to have lost his memory of the past decade. He has begun the process of re-establishing CCC, but with the King missing, it is a slow process
- With the Guild now exposed, all-out battle has broken out in the Dreamworld, with heroic individuals battling the guild in order to rid them of both worlds. 
- Great numbers of Genasi magicians have begun to appear in GGG, claiming to have come to the surface to help stabilise the broken lodestones. 

## The Repairing of a World

- XXX has seemingly been defeated in the dreamworld, and as such many have been found dead in their sleep. The Queen of EEE was one of them, and so was the Genasi prophet. Aide from them though, both leaders and peasants were found, the guild seemingly spread throughout society. 
- The Genasi have helped stopped the descent of the islands, working with the great magicians of the realm to fill the cracks in the Lodestones from within the Dreamworld.
- GGG and EEE are reformed into a new Kingdom lead by the marriage of a prince and princess from both kingdoms.

## The New Lok

- A single ship, flying of all things, has appeared from across the void, with tales of massive floating continents that have long been forgotten but have come closer to the mainland. A single scout is on the ship, and she set off not knowing what she would find.
- The floating islands are now spread across the lands at various heights. One of which a meer dozen meters from the ground.
- The vertical lands of the forgotten Genasi are being explored with larger and larger lifts being created to accommodate the movement of people.
- Access to the Dreamworld is now cut off again, with only a few people still being able to access it.
