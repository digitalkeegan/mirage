Yume (yoo-meh) is a world in constant change. It’s very nature swings back and forth between light and dark. It is populated by humans and they have a deep connection with their world. The people of Yume believe in a creator and believe that he created the world and all that is in it. First there was the Creator who always was and will always be. Out of Him formed the Tree of Life held in perpetual light, draped with giant soaring cloth, clouds and lightning. He was securely bonded with this Tree. He created all beings — plant-like in his image — within this realm of pure light. Then temptation crept in and the created sought after the same power as the Creator. To gain this power, they betrayed the Creator. This attempt at betrayal caused darkness to pour into the world. The realm trembled, cracked and split in two. Darkness had no place with the Creator and so He separated the darkness from the light into two realms. Even in betrayal, his love remained on those he created and so he formed a new realm held in the crevice between the darkness and light. As the created were falling into the world of darkness, He caught them and hid them in this cleft. He formed a new plan that one day would create a way for them to return back safely into his Kingdom of Light.
