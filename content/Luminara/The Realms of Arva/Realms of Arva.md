The Realms of Arva are a collection of solar systems and worlds created from the fragmented remains of god and crystal, brought together by the Wind Everlasting. Eons have passed, and these fragments have now been populated, many times over, by all manner of civilizations. 

At the center of the system lies the largest piece of the now broken Solar Crystal, which leaks energy in the form of light and magic back into the Realms. Fragment worlds can be found even here, many of whom do not orbit a star, but instead orbit the crystal itself. These fragments come in different shapes and sizes, from flat-topped mountains to slowly spinning disks, smaller spherical fragments to massive lattice-like structures. Because of their proximity, these fragments are rich in unique and varied magic, and the land masses themselves often interact with each other, spinning about or even colliding with one another. 

Fragment worlds that orbit the Solar Crystal are found less and less the further away you get from the galactic center. Instead, you'll find solar systems; fragment worlds orbiting suns or other objects. Again, these worlds can take many different shapes and sizes, although the majority are mostly spherical in shape.

### The Planes of Existence

The civilizations that live within the Realms of Arva are as varied as they are plentiful. As such, many of these civilizations have managed to make contact with each other and so have grown in their knowledge of their worlds. Primarily, many have begun to recognize other planes of existence, realizing that they exist within the Material Plane, one of a number of such dimensions. Although incredibly uncommon, informed knowledge (rather than simply legend or myth) of other planes have begun to spread. The Dream Realm, The Dark, and the Windy Shores have a thousand different names, in a thousand different civilizations, but all find their beginning from the myths passed down through the eons of the tales of Arva and those that worked beside her.
