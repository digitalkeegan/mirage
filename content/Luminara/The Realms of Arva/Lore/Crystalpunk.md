Technology in the vast Realms of Arva can be found at multiple levels. Thematically, the Realms are a mixture of optimistic versions of gaslamp fantasy, sailpunk, steampunk, astropunk, pure fantasy, and other magic-based-technology. 

If it's got rivets, seams, clockwork mechanics, or driven by magic, crystal, or steam, it can probably be found in the Realms. We shorten this to [[Crystalpunk]] for ease of reference.
