>[!info] **Keep Track of Why You’re Creating!**
>
>Stay on track and make your world, campaign or novel the very best it can be! It all starts with a little motivation...

#### What Is Your Motivation for Building This World?

I want to create something wholly new. A world that *feels* familiar, a world that people can get their teeth into, and yet belong to something that has never been done before. 

#### What Are You Hoping to Get Out of It?

I am hoping to create a small community of players and world builders who are passionate about creating a setting that inspires creativity in others. This TTRPG is set in a culturally-specific world, but I'd like to expand to other cultures over time.

#### What Is the Hook or Unique Selling Point of Your World? What Makes It Different?

RoA intertwines the tapestry of Middle Eastern folklore, history, and mythology, offering players an immersive world where the threads of honor, magic, and adventure are intricately woven together.

# Inspirations


#### Myth, Legends, and Historical

#### Life Experiences
#### Literary and Artistic


# Theme

>[!info] **Instil Clarity and Consistency to Your Storytelling**
From the darkest dungeon to the brightest rainbow, choose the look and feel of your world, and how noble (or grim) your heroes’ fates will be!

#### What’s the Genre of Your World?

*Knowing the genre(s) and general technology/magic level will help you set expectations about your world, and keep your world feeling cohesive.*

The Realms of Arva are realms of Epic Fantasy, magic is a well-known force in the Realms with [[Crystalpunk]] technology found in a lot of places. If pushed, it's closer to the "soft-fantasy" end of the scale.

#### How Does the World Feel (Player/reader Experience)?

*Do you want your world to feel mystical, or terrifying - or both? Should your audience be afraid or moved, filled with wanderlust or wonder? Awed by the past, or by the future? Your world will have a general feel to it, even if the specifics of tone vary from story to story.*

I do want Realms of Arva to be a "hopeful" space, to be in awe of what has happened in the past, but not because it's all downhill from there. The future should be something that is looked forward to and people are striving for a better world in general. There should be a mystical element to it, where magic is something uncontrolled and not well understood except via old tales and superstition. 

#### What Is the Character Agency Level Like?

*Character agency describes how much power the main characters or player characters have to change the world, and how long-lasting that change might be.*

*These motifs are a great way to help reinforce the feeling of your world, despite the different pacing and mood of locations or scenes within your story or campaign. They do not need to feature in every single session or scene.*

Character (or rather group) agency is certainly massive. As a collaborative world building experience, Realms of Arva is pushed by it's creators, and thus specific characters in the world, in massive ways. 

#### What Is the Tone of Your World

*Is your world 
*- **dark** (e.g. Game of Thrones, Battlestar Galactica, The Witcher)*  
*- or **bright** (e.g. original Star Trek, the Princess Bride, My Little Pony),*  
*- or **somewhere in the middle** (e.g. StarGate, Harry Potter, Shannara Chronicles)?*  
*How pleasant or difficult is it to live there, in general? Do horrible or wondrous things happen to ordinary people?**

Somewhere in the middle. I'd like it to be mostly bright, but because of the need for significant, actual, conflict, there's going to need to be some significant issues to come to blows over; rather then a single massive enemy.

#### What Are the Recurring Themes Which Reinforce the Genre, Tone and Feel of Your World?

*A few recurring themes can help anchor your audience in your tone and genre, and establish your hook. What three motifs/scenes/themes capture the world you’re trying to create?*

I am interested in encouraging people to go for conflicts within what subtxt.app calls the [Aspirational Family](https://web.archive.org/web/20220119143634/https://subtxt.app/motivations/)

# For Later

## Focus

>[!important] **Focus the Subjects You Will Be Expanding On**

**Choose three to five focal points of your world to focus your worldbuilding on**  
It’s a sad truth of worldbuilding that you can’t create EVERYTHING! Decide a few focus points you want to expand on. This will give the impression that your world is very deep and detailed. You can always expand more areas later!

**Examples might include (this list is not exhaustive!)**

-   Government Presence
-   Rule Of Law
-   Social Services
-   Economic Strength
-   Wealth Distribution
-   Agriculture And Trade
-   Race Relations
-   Class Relations
-   Gender Relations
-   Sexual Orientation Relations
-   Military Influence
-   Religious Influence
-   Technology Influence
-   Arts And Culture Influence

### First Focus Point
Rule of Law. Specifically, the ability to be free, conflicted with the necessity of law to keep society functional for higher purposes.

Control vs Freedom

### SECOND FOCUS POINT
Technology Influence. Specifically the impact of technology over natural order.

Logic (tech) vs Feeling (nature)
Help (tech) vs Hinder (nature)


### THIRD FOCUS POINT
I'd like it to be something to do with pursuing and avoiding to reflect Christ's pursuing of us. But I'm unsure what  this looks like. It could be within the Religious sphere, but that seems on the nose. 

## Drama

**ADDING DRAMA IS THE WAY TO PUT YOUR WORLD IN MOTION**

***Add 5 points of drama to your world:**
Drama is the current affairs of your world - what’s happening right now. You can use one or two of them for your main plot line, but the rest are just there to create the impression of a larger world in motion. Drama is a great source not only of side quests and B plots, but also of background dialogue!  
  
If you need to add more, use this expanded section*

#### DRAMA POINT 1

#### DRAMA POINT 2

#### DRAMA POINT 3

#### DRAMA POINT 4

#### DRAMA POINT 5

#### EXPANDED DRAMA

Fill here any other minor drama points that are either local or personal to the characters / party and/or story you are currently exploring
## Scene
**DESCRIBE YOUR WORLD'S BASIC PROPERTIES**

Make your setting feel unique with strange geographical quirks, bizarre weather, and deep magic.

#### WHAT ARE THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES IN THE NATURAL LAWS OF YOUR WORLD COMPARED TO EARTH? (RULES OF THE WORLD)

Does your world have magic or altered gravity, midichlorians or psionics? Are the gods wandering the world? Nail down your world’s natural laws now - they will have fundamental repercussions on everything else in your world!

*Make sure you sense-check with your previous answers - if your genre is hard sci-fi, you might not want to introduce magic, for example.

#### HOW DID THIS WORLD COME TO BE? (COSMOLOGY)

The dominant religion, The Children of the Suns, believes that the world is the child of the twin suns, La and Tho. In reality, the world was intentionally created from a nebula by aliens who will be back to check on it someday...

Write how your world ACTUALLY came to be - was it born from an egg, created by a god, or sneezed into being? You can add the prevalent in-world belief if you like. Just one paragraph on this - don't go full Silmarillion!

#### WHAT DOES THE GEOGRAPHY OF YOUR WORLD LOOK LIKE?  
DOES YOUR GEOGRAPHY HAVE ANY SPECIAL PROPERTIES OR FEATURES?

This should be a generic vision of your geography. Is your world full of volcanos and lava flows or floating islands? Is it an ice planet, or a desert waste? Is it a planet-city like Coruscant? Is it bio-diverse or all the same?

From winters which last decades (Game of Thrones, G.R.R. Martin) to moons which throw destructive spores (World of Pern, Anne MacCaffery ), extraordinary geographical features can add character and challenges to your world. What are the fundamental truths of the physical geography of your world?

**Remember to refer back to your genre, tone and motifs in your Foundation! They’ll give you a tonne of inspiration for this.**

#### WHAT IS THE INITIAL SIZE OF YOUR ACTIVE SETTING?

What is the initial scale* of your active storytelling space? An island, a region or a continent, for example?

Defining your initial active setting doesn’t mean your players or main characters can’t go elsewhere! But it does help you create a starting point which feels rich and alive.

Remember this will be affected by the genre! If you’re playing a Star Trek campaign, you’ll be exploring different planets, so an active area might be a solar system or a cluster of systems.
## People
**EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF SENTIENCE IN YOUR WORLD**

Breathe life into your world with great fallen empires, forgotten cities and lost civilizations. Add conflict and drama with the struggles and politics of today.

#### WHO USED TO LIVE HERE, AND WHAT’S THEIR HISTORY?

Write max. 1 paragraph on each lost civilization that was active in the area. Remember you can always add more later, which have not yet been discovered!

This is where the unknown mysteries come from, and a great source of dungeons, secrets, adventures, unique items and more. Also makes your world feel living and established. If you want your world to feel brand new and unsettled, write instead about the geological history of your world - the fossils that people will find.

#### WHICH SPECIES/CULTURES LIVE HERE NOW AND WHAT’S THEIR HISTORY?

Keep it brief! A paragraph is enough for the major civilizations. A sentence is plenty for any minor cultures which might be part of the adventure. Add other cultures not in your main storytelling area in one additional sentence.

#### WHAT DO THEY NEED, AND WHAT DO THEY NEED FROM EACH OTHER?

For each group, limit your answer to one paragraph, and remember to include one sentence on their opinion of "others". Detail other cultures not in your main storytelling area in one additional sentence.

For example, who are they? What do they look like? Start with a little bit of history, and then turn that into an attitude and a need.
