Conflict is very deadly in Mirage. Be sure to ask yourself, is it worth it?
## Maps & Zones 

A violent conflict is typically played out using a map of the location where your characters happen to find themselves fighting for their lives. The map is divided into zones. A zone is typically a room, a corridor, or an area of ground. How big a zone is varies – from a few steps across up to about 25 meters. A zone is generally smaller in a cramped environment than in open terrain. In pre-made scenario material, zones are usually indicated on a location map. In random encounters created on the fly, the GM can make a quick sketch of the area or simply describe it. 

**Playing without maps:** Although maps can be useful, you can always choose not to use them and let certain conflicts play out only in the “theater of the mind.” This can be a good solution in close quarters conflicts between a small number of combatants. 

### Zone Features 
Zones can have various features, which affect actions performed within them. Here are some examples: 

**Cluttered:** The zone is covered by dense undergrowth or filled with debris of some sort. You must roll for Grace when you move into the zone. Failure means you manage to get into the zone, but you fall down. 

**Dimly Lit:** The zone is dimly lit. Observation rolls in the zone get a −2 modifier. Ranged attacks into the zone also suffer a −2 modifier, and can’t pass through the zone.

**Cramped:** A crawlspace or narrow tunnel. In a cramped zone, you can only crawl, not run. You also cannot move or shoot past individuals next to you against targets behind them. 

### Borders & Line of Sight 
The border between two adjacent zones can be open or blocked by a wall. A blocked border can have a door or a hatch, as indicated by the map, allowing movement between the two zones.

Open borders don’t block vision or movement. A blocked border generally blocks line of sight even if there is a door or hatch in it – unless you’re actively standing by the doorway and peeking through. 

### Range Categories 
The distance between you and your opponents is divided into five range categories. See the adjacent table.

| Range | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Engaged | Right next to you |
| Short | A few meters away, in the same zone as you |
| Medium | Up to 25 meters away, in an adjacent zone |
| Long | Up to about one hundred meters (four zones) away |
| Extreme | Up to about one kilometer |

## Rounds & Initiative 

Combat is played out in rounds, each roughly 5–10 seconds long, split into two Turns. When combat begins, the first step is to determine who has the initiative. Do this before anyone rolls dice for an action. 

### Group Initiative
There are only two turns, the player's turn and then the adversary's turn. Starting with the player's turn, they go back and forth until combat has concluded.
### Surprise 
If either party initiates combat with an attack that the GM deems completely surprising, they can take a full turn before standard combat begins. This means that if the party initiates a surprise, they will have two full turns before the adversary's turn. If the party is taken by surprise, then the adversaries gain a full turn, and then standard combat ensues. Also see Ambushes. 

Individuals within a party can also surprise an enemy (like a sneak attack, see below). If this occurs, only those who initiated the surprise can act before normal combat ensues. 
### Standoffs
Combat is deadly, *very* deadly. Even if one doesn't lose their life, the social blowback received if others deem them dishonourable can be crippling. For most people who call Al-Sarab home, combat is the last resort - understanding that there is often no turning back once blood has been spilt. Because of this, it isn't uncommon for adversaries to find themselves in a standoff, an environment where each seeks violence but is unwilling to make the first move and be found dishonourable given an unfortunate end. In a standoff, all members of the party roll on Agility. Anyone in the party who rolls a success can all take a turn together first. Then the adversaries take their turn, and then standard combat ensues.

> [!info] No one acts
> You can use the standoff rules whenever there is a situation where neither side of a conflict is willing to act first.

### The Player's Turn
On the player's turn, actions can happen in any order. Players can intersperse actions, including movement, among each other’s actions as much as convenient. When "your turn" is used, it is referring to a single player acting within the player's turn. The phrase “your next turn” means the next upcoming point in which you take an action, whether that happens to be in the current round or the next round. The phrase “your previous turn” means your latest previous point in which you took an action, whether it was in the current round or the previous round

> [!warning] Interruptions
> Players should note that enemies have the same action options as they do. Some actions will give your opponent the opportunity to perform a reactive action that breaks the turn order. Actions that occur in the other party's turn are called interruptions. Interruptions are a frequent part of combat in Mirage! 

## Slow & Fast Actions

During the player's turn, *each player can perform one slow action and one fast action, or two fast actions*. See the lists of typical slow and fast actions below. 

**Free Actions**: Dropping to the ground or shouting a few words are called free actions – they don’t count toward your two actions for the round, but you can only do them on your own turn.

### Describe Your Actions 
When you want to act, simply state which actions you wish to perform and roll dice if needed to see if you are successful. 

>[!question] Mark Your Actions 
>Because players can act in any order and interruptions occur out of turn, it can sometimes be hard to keep track of how many actions the combatants have performed. A tip is to keep track of this by using tokens or cards. Two types of card or token (one for fast actions, one for slow actions) is even better. All actions are refreshed at the start of each round.

### Helping Others 
If you wish to help another player character or NPC perform an action, it costs you one action of the same kind (slow or fast). You must state you are trying to help someone before any dice are rolled.

### Slow Actions
| Action | Prerequisite | Skill |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Close combat attack | - | Bladework |
| Shoot ranged weapon | Ranged weapon | Marksmanship |
| Reload | Ranged weapon | - |
| First aid | Broken or dying victim | Healing |
| Crawl | You are prone | - |
| Persuade | Your opponent can hear you | Inspiration |
| Cast a spell | Relevant Talent and Spell prerequisites | Varies |
### Fast Actions
| Fast Action | Prerequisite | Skill |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Move | No Engaged enemy | Grace (in cluttered zone) |
| Move through an unlocked door or hatch | - | - |
| Get up | You are prone | - |
| Draw weapon | - | - |
| Block attack | Attacked in close combat | Bladework |
| Grapple attack | You've grappled an opponent | Bladework |
| Retreat | Engaged enemy | Grace |
| Aim | Ranged weapon | - |
| Seek cover | Cover in same zone | - |
| Steer | Mount | Grace |
| Saddle up onto a Mount | Mount | Grace |
| Use item | Varies | Varies |
| Cast a power word spell | Relevant Talent and Spell prerequisites | Varies |
## Movement

To move during combat, you can spend a fast action to move from one zone to a neighbouring zone or between Short and Engaged range from an enemy or PC in the same zone you are already in. No roll is required to move, unless it’s into a Cluttered zone. 

**Crawling**: Moving while prone, i.e. crawling, is a slow action. That means you can’t crawl twice in the same round. In a cramped or inclosed zone, crawling is the only movement possible. 

**Close Combat:** If you have an active enemy at Engaged range, you can’t just walk away from them. Instead, you must retreat. 

**Doors & Hatches:** You can open an unlocked door or hatch with a fast action. A locked door or hatch can be broken down. A typical wooden door or hatch can take 5 points of damage before it gives in. More sturdy doors require more force, and also have an armor rating. 

**Mounts:** Movement for mounts is handled with special rules. 

### Retreat 
If you have an active enemy at Engaged range and there is no barrier between you, you must make a Grace roll to move away from your adversary. If you fail, you still move but your enemy gets an immediate, free close combat attack against you. The free attack occurs out of turn order and it doesn’t count toward their actions in the round. You cannot block it. 

## Ambushes & Sneak Attacks 

One, particularly useful, way to win a conflict is to attack when your enemy least expects it. You can achieve this in several different ways. 

**Sneak Attack:** When you sneak up on someone undetected and perform an attack, it is called a sneak attack. First you make a Shadowcraft roll. Moving close enough to attack in melee combat (Engaged range) gives you a −2 modifier. If you fail, the enemy notices you and combat ensues. 
If you succeed, your attack counts as surprising, which means that you will act before normal combat ensues. For a close combat sneak attack, you also get a +3 modifier, and the target cannot block the attack. Sneak attacks are always performed individually, by one attacker against one target. 

**Ambush:** A special kind of sneak attack is an ambush – lying in wait for an enemy and attacking as it passes by. In this case each victim makes an Observation roll to spot the ambush, with a −2 modifier if the attackers are well prepared. All those that fail skip their first turn of combat. 

## Close Combat

When you attack in close combat, use the Bladework skill. Close combat happens at Engaged range from your target. There can be no barrier between you and your target. If there is, you must first cross the barrier. Cover has no effect against close combat attacks. 

**Damage:** If your roll succeeds, you hit your adversary and inflict your weapon’s base damage rating on them. Each extra success will increase the damage by 1. 

**Stance:** If you are prone, your close combat attacks get a −2 modifier. Getting up is a fast action. Close combat attacks against a prone target get a +2 modifier. 

**Defenseless Target:** If you attack a defenseless or unaware target, you get a +3 modifier. This is not further increased if the target is prone.

### Special Attacks 
In close combat, you might want to achieve a different result than simply hurting your opponent. This must be declared before you roll any dice, and it can only be done if you fight unarmed. 

✦ You wrestle a hand-held item from your opponent’s grasp. You can keep the item or throw it into an adjacent zone as part of the attack. 
✦ You trip your opponent to the ground. 
✦ You push your opponent to Short range. 
✦ You pin your enemy in a tight clinch. See Grappling, below. 

**Grappling:** If you successfully grapple your opponent, both you and your opponent fall to the ground. The opponent drops any weapon they were holding, and cannot move. The only action they can perform is an attempt to break free – which is a slow action that succeeds if the opponent wins an opposed Bladework roll against you. While you are grappling, the only action you can perform (apart from releasing your opponent) is a grapple attack. This works as a normal unarmed attack, but is a fast action and cannot be blocked. 

**Diving Blow:** If you, in a single round, first move into Engaged range of an enemy and then attack them with an unarmed blow, you get a +2 modifier to the attack. This is called a diving blow. If the attack hits, you inflict damage normally, and both you and the target fall prone. If the attack fails, only you fall to the ground.

### Blocking 
When an enemy attacks you in close combat, you can roll for Bladework to block their attack to avoid being hit. This is a fast action. You must declare that you are attempting to block the attack before the attacker rolls for their strike. This effectively turns the attack into an opposed roll. Every success you roll eliminates one from the attacker’s roll. Excess successes have no effect.

**Blocking Unarmed:** If you are unarmed, you can only block unarmed attacks from other humanoids. To block an armed close combat attack, or an attack by an animal or beast of some type, you need to wield some kind of sturdy weapon or tool. 

**Actions:** Blocking breaks the turn order, but it does count against your two available actions in the round (one slow and one fast). For every block you perform, you get one less action when it is your turn, and once you have used both your actions during the round for blocks, you can no longer block further attacks. All actions are refreshed at the beginning of each new round. You can save unused actions to block later in the round, but never from one round to the next.

### Close Combat Modifiers
| Factor | Modifier |
| ---- | ---- |
| Attacker prone | -2 |
| Target prone | +2 |
| Defenceless target | +3 |
| Diving blow | +2 |

## Ranged Combat 

To attack someone with a hand-held ranged weapon, roll for Marksmanship, except for thrown weapons, which use Grace. To draw a weapon is a fast action, while firing a weapon is a slow action. 

**Damage:** If your attack succeeds, you hit your target and inflict your weapon’s base damage rating on them. Each extra success increases the damage by 1. 

**Range:** The weapons tables indicate the range of each weapon, i.e. the maximum range category at which the weapon can be used. The farther away your target is, the harder it is to hit. At Medium range you get a −1 modification, and at Long range you get −2. At Engaged range you get −3, because it’s hard to draw a bead on an opponent that close. You don’t get this penalty if you fire at a defenseless or unwitting enemy – instead, you get a +3 modification. 

**Target Size:** Firing at a large target, such as a huge creature, gives a +2 modifier to the attack. Firing at a small object, such a hatch or a hand-held item, gives a −2 modifier.

**Unseen Target:** If you can’t see your target (because of darkness or cover) but still have a good idea of where they are, you can still fire, but with a −2 modifier. 

### Aimed Fire
If you take your time to aim carefully before squeezing the trigger, you get a +2 to your attack roll. Aiming is a fast action. If you do anything else except shoot your weapon after you have aimed, or if you are hurt, you lose the effect of the aim and you need to spend another fast action to aim again. 

### Ranged Fire Modifiers
| Factor           | Modifier  |
|------------------|-----------|
| Aimed shot       | +2        |
| Target Engaged   | −3/+3     |
| Short range      | —         |
| Medium range     | —        |
| Long range       | −1        |
| Extreme range    | −2        |
| Large target     | +2        |
| Small target     | −2        |
| Dim light        | −1        |
| Darkness         | -2         |

### Bows & Slingshots 
When using Bows and slingshots, nocking an arrow or placing a stone in your sling is considered “reloaded” – you need to spend a fast action to prepare the weapon. Once you have readied your weapon, you can’t do anything except shoot or aim (above) – if you do anything else, you must prepare the weapon again before you can shoot. Crossbows don’t need to be prepared in this manner. They can be carried loaded as a firearm, and loading it is a slow action

### Overwatch 
As a fast action, you can assume an overwatch position in a specified direction, as long as you have a ranged weapon and no enemies within Engaged range. This means that you aim in the specified direction and are ready to shoot. Between the time you assume the overwatch position and your time to act in the next round, you can fire your weapon against a target in the chosen direction. You can fire whenever you want in either your own, or the enemy's, turn Your shot is resolved before all other actions – even if they are already declared. For example, if an enemy in the direction you are aiming attempts to fire a weapon, you can shoot first. The enemy is not allowed to change their attack after your overwatch attack.

Firing when in overwatch position counts as a normal attack (a slow action). Therefore, you must save your slow action in the round for any overwatch attack you want to make. If both you and an enemy assume overwatch positions against each other, and both choose to fire against each other, then an opposed Marksmanship roll determines which attack goes first. This roll does not count as an action for either of you. 

**Losing Overwatch:** You keep your overwatch position until you break it, or any of the following occurs: 
✦ You perform any action other than overwatch fire. 
✦ You are attacked in close combat. 
✦ You suffer damage

### Cover 
When enemies are shooting at you, hunkering down behind cover – preferably something solid – can save your life. Taking cover in the zone you’re in counts as a fast action. Cover has an armor rating and works exactly like armor – but only against ranged attacks. Cover can be degraded just like armor. Cover can be combined with armor – roll for cover first, then armor.

| Barrier | Armor Rating |
| ---- | ---- |
| Furniture | D6 |
| Wooden Door | D8 |
| Tree Trunk | D8 |
| Wooden Wall | D10 |
| Stone Wall | D12 |

## Weapons

Using a weapon will greatly improve your effectiveness in combat. The table below describes a few typical weapons of various types. The features used in the weapon tables are explained below. 

**Grip:** Indicates if you need one or two hands to wield the weapon. A two-handed weapon can’t be combined with a shield, and some critical injuries will prohibit the use of two-handed weapons. 

**Damage:** Indicates your base damage rating, i.e. how many points of damage your opponent suffers if your attack is successful. If you roll extra successes, you deal additional points of Stress (described below). 

**Range:** Indicates the maximum range category at which the weapon can be used. 

### Weapons
| Weapon | Grip | Damage | Range |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Unarmed | — | 1 | Engaged |
| Blunt instrument | 1H | 1 | Engaged |
| Knife | 1H | 2 | Engaged |
| Club | 1H | 1 | Engaged |
| Sword | 1H | 2 | Engaged |
| Battleaxe | 2H | 3 | Engaged |
| Spear | 1H | 2 | Short |
| Rock | 1H | 1 | Medium |
| Sling | 1H | 1 | Medium |
| Bow | 2H | 1 | Long |
| Pistol | 1H | 2 | Medium |
| Rifle | 2H | 2 | Long |

## Body Armor 

Body armor can protect you from damage. Armor doesn’t provide protection from other kinds of damage, or from damage you inflict on yourself when you push a roll. The effect of armor is determined by its armor rating, and is measured via dice type (D6, D8, D10, D12) just like attributes and skills. When you suffer damage from a physical attack, roll two dice corresponding to the armor rating. Every success you roll decreases the damage by one. This roll does not count as an action and cannot be pushed
## Damage & Stress

You can suffer "damage" in many ways in Mirage, and they result in Conditions and/or Stress. Conditions are described in Chapter 3. These are the most common ways you'll receive either of these: 

### Stressful Situations
When your PC is subjected to fear or a stressful situation, the GM determines the potential stress inflicted. You then make an Intuition or Survival Instincts roll depending on the situation and GM discretion. This roll is not an action. Each success rolled eliminates one point of potential stress. You can pray on the roll, but at the risk of suffering a Condition. The maximum stress you can bare is measured by your Resolve, which is decided at character creation.

> [!info] Stress with NPCs and Enemies
> NPCs and Enemies usually do not have a Resolve value and track Stress. When this is the case, whenever Stress would be inflicted (like additional successes in an attack roll), Mental Conditions are inflicted instead. They also do not roll Intuition or Survival Instincts to decrease the amount given.
### Attacks
Whenever you attack someone in combat, you inflict damage equal to the base damage rating of the weapon. Each point of damage usually results in a single Condition. For each extra success rolled beyond the first you deal one point of Stress. The same goes for damage from explosions, fire, etc. Conditions inflicted on someone due to an attack result in Physical Conditions.

> [!example] 
> For example, a one-handed sword has a Damage rating of 2. If a player succeeds at a Bladecraft roll while making a close combat attack action, they would inflict 2 Conditions on their enemy. If they roll any additional successes, for each extra success that enemy would incur Stress. If the enemy doesn't track Stress, Mental Conditions are inflicted instead (see above).

### Unanswered Prayer
How unanswered prayer rolls can inflict Conditions is described in Chapter 3. Armor has no effect against damage from unanswered prayer. 

### Stressful Situations
| Factor                                | Stress |
|---------------------------------------|--------|
| Being threatened with violence        | 1      |
| Seeing a friendly character suffer a lethal critical injury | 1      |
| Seeing something unnatural            | 1      |
| Seeing a friendly character die       | 2      |
| Being interrogated                    | 2      |
| Facing a frightening supernatural being | 2      |
| Witnessing a massacre                 | 3      |
| Being tortured                        | 3      |
| Witnessing a horrible supernatural event | 3      |

## Broken

In Mirage, your PC can be broken by Conditions or Stress. When you already have three Conditions of the same type and acquire a fourth one, you become Broken. If you receive Stress in excess of your Resolve you will become Broken. Being Broken means that you are seriously injured, temporarily insane, or otherwise worn down. You may not perform any actions, physical or mental. In addition, a Broken player character also sustains a critical injury.

### Recovery 
Being broken is not fatal in itself – only critical injuries can actually kill you. There are two ways to recover after being broken, assuming you’re not dead. 

**Getting Help:** Someone can help you recover by using the Healing skill. This is a slow action. If the roll is successful, you immediately heal damage or stress equal to the number of successes rolled. The Healing roll only has this effect on a broken victim. 

**On Your Own:** If no one is around to help you, you automatically heal one point of damage or stress after one quarter-day has passed. 

**Not Broken?** If you are not broken, you heal one condition or point of stress per quarter-day (5 - 10 hours). You can heal damage and stress at the same time. This assumes that you are not suffering from something relatively extreme - like if you're starving, dehydrated, or hypothermic (the GM determines this). 

> [!important] Broken NPCs
NPCs can be broken in the same ways as PCs. An NPC can use Healing on a PC and vice versa. However, dice are usually not rolled when an NPC heals another NPC – instead, the GM decides what happens. The GM can also decide that a minor NPC who is broken by damage simply dies. 

## Critical Injuries 

Critical injuries are dangerous, even lethal, injuries to your body or mind. You suffer a physical critical injury when you are broken by physical conditions, and a mental critical injury when you are broken by mental conditions.

>[!info] Damage through Unanswered Prayer 
>There is one case where you don’t risk any critical injury when broken: when your prayer isn't answered to such an extent that you break yourself. This is very rare, but it can happen. This means you can never kill yourself due to unanswered prayer. 

### Rolling for the Crit 
When you suffer a critical injury, you roll on a table to see what it is. These can be found below.
### Death 
Physical critical injuries can be lethal. If you suffer such an injury, you must make a death save when the listed time limit has passed – one round, stretch, or quarter-day. If the time limit is a round, make the roll on your next turn. The death save is not an action in itself. A death save is a roll for Endurance. If a death save fails, you die. If you succeed, you linger on, but you must make another death save when the listed amount of time has passed again. 

**Stabilizing Crits**: To stabilize a lethal critical injury and save your life, one or more Healing rolls must be made. Medical gear can give positive modifiers to the roll.
The Healing roll takes the same amount of time to perform as the time limit of your critical injury. If the roll succeeds, the time limit of your crit is increased by one category (e.g., from round to stretch). When a crit with a time limit of a quarter-day is successfully treated, you no longer risk dying and you don’t need to make any further death saves. If the Healing roll fails, trying again is allowed – but only after another death save has been made. 

**Broken:** If you are both broken and have sustained a lethal critical injury, two separate Healing rolls are needed: one to get you back on your feet, and another one to save your life. These two rolls can be made in whichever order you prefer. 

**Instant Kill:** Note that some critical injuries will kill you outright. If you gain any of these, your character dies immediately. No death save is allowed.

### Healing Crits
Each critical injury has a specific effect that you suffer during the healing time indicated, which is measured in days. If you have several crits, they will heal simultaneously. If an injury is listed as permanent, it will never heal. 

**Skill Modifiers:** Skill roll modifiers due to critical injuries are cumulative, and apply even if you don’t have the skill. 

**Care:** If someone tends to you for a quarter-day per day during the process of healing a critical injury and makes a Healing roll, that day counts double. 

**Damage:** Note that you can heal all of your damage, but still suffer the effects of a critical injury.

## Healing 

After violent or frightening encounters, you and your friends may need to heal your Conditions and Stress . This section describes ways in which you can help each other. Some of this has already been mentioned in Chapter 3, but is repeated here to avoid having to flip back and forth unnecessarily.

### Healing Cheat Sheet
| Action | Time | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Treat critical injury | Round | Treat a Broken character with Healing or Inspiration  during combat (each extra success heals an additional Condition) |
| Heal physical Conditions | Day | Use Healing in a safe location to heal three Conditions per success for someone else (including Broken) |
| Heal mental Conditions | Day | Use Inspiration in a safe space while having a close dialogue to heal three Conditions per success for someone else (including Broken) |
| Rest | Scene | Describe a scene together with one or several other PCs to recover from two Conditions (except Broken), once per day. |
| Services | Scene | Use Resources and describe a scene where you, alone or with friends, receive medical services (see separate table) |

### Healing Conditions 
You can use Healing rolls to heal other people’s physical Conditions, but not your own. You and your patients must spend a full day on treatment, in a secure location where you can drink, eat, and rest. You cannot do anything else that day. 
Likewise, you can use Inspiration to cure others of their mental Conditions. 

In addition to spending a day, and having access to a safe place, food, and beverages, your friends must willingly engage in close contact and dialogue with you. If the skill test succeeds, your patients heal a total of three Conditions which you distribute between them. They decide which Conditions are healed. Broken can also be healed this way. Each extra success can be used to heal another three Conditions. A failed skill test usually means that a day has been wasted, and may also give an enemy time to take further action against the characters. A patient cannot have her physical or mental Conditions treated by more than one person at a time. However, it is possible for one person to treat the physical Conditions while another treats the mental ones. While you are treating the Conditions of others, you yourself may not receive treatment. That goes for both physical and mental Conditions.

> [!reminder]
> Remember, if you are not broken, you heal one condition or point of stress per quarter-day (5 - 10 hours). You can heal damage and stress at the same time. This assumes that you are not suffering from something relatively extreme - like if you're starving, dehydrated, or hypothermic (the GM determines this). 

### Treating Critical Injuries 
When you have sustained a critical injury that might either kill you or become chronic, someone must treat you with Healing or Inspiration before the time limit expires. If it succeeds, you cease to be Broken, while retaining all other Conditions. Extra successes can be used to heal additional Conditions. If the attempt fails, the person treating you must either find help, gather more medical supplies, or move you to a safer location before she can try again. If no one has successfully treated you before the time runs out, you either die or become permanently Broken. Then it is time to create a new player character.

### Prayer and Meditation
It is possible to heal your own Conditions by praying or meditating. Summarize what happens or play a short scene. This heals two mental or physical Conditions of your choice, although Broken cannot be healed this way. You can do this once per day, and cannot use Activities to heal simultaneously (see below). This does not count for Preparatory Prayer (see Chapter 3).

### Activities 
It is possible to heal your own Conditions by engaging in an activity that provides relaxation and rest. Summarize what happens or play a short scene. The activity must involve at least one other person, NPC or player character. For example, you can have a conversation with someone or spend some time alone in the woods while a friend keeps watch nearby. Activities heal two mental or physical Conditions of your choice, although Broken cannot be healed this way. Even if multiple player characters are participating in the scene, only one will heal Conditions. You can heal Conditions through activities once per day, or as often as the Gamemaster sees fit. 

**Examples of Activities:** 
- Drinking alcohol
- Intellectual discussions
- Watching a play
- Romantic meeting
- Storytelling
- Singing or dancing
- Keeping a journal
- Arguing
- Confession 
- Playing cards 
- Arm wrestling
- Tending to the sick, poor, or vulnerable

### Services and Establishments 
Finally, it is possible to purchase medical attention or heal Conditions at a local physician’s office, by recuperating at some finer establishment, traveling lavishly, or resting at a nice home or inn. In this case, all participants may heal Conditions, and in addition, you can perform the activity yourself. In other words, seeking medical attention at an establishment can only be done in lieu of a regular activity. The difficulty of finding a service is measured from 1-3. 

| Services | Difficulty | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Traditional Healer | 1 | Heals Broken |
| Skilled Physician | 2 | Heals Broken and one mental Condition |
| Personal Alchemyst or Wise Scholar | 3 | Heals Broken and any two Conditions |
| Barber | 1 | Heals one mental Condition |
| Bathing facility | 2 | Restores two mental Conditions |
| Messenger Runner | 1 | Allows the PCs to call in a contact during the next scene, if they pass a Inspiration test |
| Homing Bird | 2 | Allows the PCs to call in a contact during the next scene |
| Nomadic Courier | 3 | Allows the PCs to call in a contact or get hold of an item small enough to be carried during the next scene |
| Caravan Escort | 2 | Travel to a new location and heal one Condition |
| Riverboat or Desert Sail | 3 | Travel to a new location and heal three Conditions |
| Oasis Refuge or Traveler's Inn | 1 | Overnight accommodation with opportunities for rest or medical aid |
| Grand Hall or Retreat | 3 | Overnight accommodation and food that heals one Condition |
| Sustaining Meal | 1 | Last a few days without Endurance tests |
| Extravagant Feast | 2 | Last several days without Endurance tests |
| Festive Banquet | 3 | Last several days without Endurance tests and heal a mental Condition |
## Mounts 

A horse or other riding animal can be a useful asset. The animal can carry gear for you, and you can take advantage of being in the saddle during combat. 

**Movement:** Mounts allow you to move faster in combat than on foot. When making a move action, make a Grace roll – for each success, you may move an additional zone. Mounts generally can’t move into Cramped zones at all. In Cluttered zones, they can only move one zone per action. 

**Move:** When you are on horseback and make a Grace roll, use the animal’s Agility instead of your own. 

**Close Combat:** You can fight from horseback, but only with one-handed weapons. Opponents attacking you must decide if they attack you or the horse. Attacks against a mounted rider suffer a −1 penalty. 

**Ranged Combat:** All ranged attacks from horseback suffer a −2 modification. Opponents shooting at you must decide if they attack you or the horse. 

**Damage:** Your mount can suffer damage, just like you, through attacks or by pushing rolls when you are using the animal’s attribute score. Animals recover damage just like PCs. An animal that has its Strength reduced to zero does not suffer a critical injury, instead it is considered perished. Animals generally don’t have Wits or Empathy.
