# 1) Introduction

## The Basics
This section introduces some key concepts in roleplaying, and how they are used in games of [[Mirage]]. 

### The Players
Each player except one controls a player character (PC). You decide what your PC thinks and feels, what they say and do – but not what happens to them. It is your job as a player to immerse yourself in your PC. They may be an adventurer in a faraway fantasy world – but they are still, at heart, a person with feelings and dreams, just like you. Try to imagine – how would you react if you were in their shoes? What would you do? The player characters are always the protagonists of the story. The game is about you. Your decisions, your adventures. 

### The Gamemaster 
The final player is the Gamemaster, the GM. They describe the game world to you, they portray the people you meet, and they control the enemies you fight. The game is a conversation between the players and the GM, back and forth, until a critical situation arises where the outcome is uncertain. Then it’s time to break out the dice – read more about this in Chapter 3. It is the GM’s job to put obstacles in your path and challenge your PCs, forcing them to show what they’re real- ly made of. But it is not up to the GM to decide everything that happens in the game – and above all, not how your story is supposed to end. That is decided in the game. That is why you are playing the game – to find out how your story ends.

## Tools of the Game

### Character Sheets 
To document your character, you use a character sheet. How you create your character will be described in the next chapter. 

### Dice
As a character in [[Mirage]], you will have to take risks. Sooner or later, you will end up in situations where the outcome is uncertain, no matter how skilled you are. It’s time to break out the dice. [[Mirage]] uses polyhedral dice, including D6, D8, D10 and D12. It is also recommended that you have each set of dice in a couple of different colours - though not necessary.

> [!important] Rolling Dice 
The rules will sometimes ask you to roll D3, 2D6, D66, and D100. D3 means you roll a D6 and divide the result by two, rounding up. 2D6 means you roll two six-sided dice and add the results. D66 means you roll two D6. The first die represents the tens digit and the second die represents the ones digit. That generates a result between 11 and 66. D100 means you roll two D10. The first represents the tens digit and the second the ones digit. A double zero counts as 100. You can even roll D666, by rolling three six-sided dice. The first die then counts as the hundreds digit, the second as the tens digit and the third as the ones digit

### A Deck of Cards
Grab ten cards, numbered 1 through 10. A suit of any normal deck of cards works fine if you remove the face cards and count the ace as 1. Otherwise 10 sections of paper labelled 1 through 10 will also do.

### Playing Safely 
In [[Mirage]], you are largely in control of the story, and with this comes responsibility. The player characters will face great danger and difficult challenges, but no player should find the situations they experience unpleasant or offensive. It is import- ant that everyone around the gaming table is having fun and feeling safe. 

Before starting the game, talk things through and see if someone wants certain subjects to be kept out of the game. Always respect a player who wants to pause and discuss what is happening in the game, or even leave the table if the player so chooses. And you may also want to talk about what happened after the game session.

# 2) Player Characters

Your player character (PC) is your most important asset in any Year Zero Engine game. They are your avatar, your eyes and ears in the world. But they, in return, depend on you making the right decisions for them. Take your PC seriously and play them as if they were a real person. It’s more fun that way. At the same time, don’t try to protect your PC from every conceivable danger. The goal of the game is to create a good story. For that to happen you need to take risks. During the course of the game, your PC will change and develop. Their skills and specialties can be developed through experience, but you can also discover how their personality changes and is formed in a way that cannot be measured by numbers on a page. This is when your player character truly comes alive. 

### Character Sheet 
To create your player character, you need a character sheet. This SRD does not include a character sheet, as any YZE game will need a sheet adapted to the specific rules version and game setting. 

>[!important] Seven Steps of Creation 
How you create your player character is explained in detail in this chapter. The summary below is a helpful overview. Grab a character sheet, a pencil, and follow these steps: 
>1. Choose your archetype.
>2. Determine your attributes.
>3. Determine your skills. 
>4. Choose your starting specialty. 
>5. Determine your personality traits. 
>6. Pick your gear. 
>7. Choose a name. 

### Archetype 
Most Year Zero Engine games have some type of character archetypes to choose from. The archetypes – which can also be called “roles,” “professions,” or “careers” – are based on the game world, and help the players grasp the setting. 
The archetype determines what type of person you are, your background and role in the group. Your archetype will influence your attributes, skills, specialties, and starting gear. 
Archetypes can feel stereotypical, and they are meant to be. Picking an archetype is a quick way for yourself and the other players to get an immediate feel for your character. But remember that your character is more than just their archetype. The archetype is just a starting point toward creating a unique player character. 

| Archetype   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Primary Attribute | Skills                                                                | Sub-Archetypes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Attributes 
Your character has four attributes that indicate your basic physical and mental capabilities. Your attributes are used when you roll dice to perform actions in the game, and also determine how much damage and stress can withstand before you become broken. Read more about this in Chapter 4. 

✦ **STRENGTH**: Raw muscle power and brawn 
✦ **AGILITY**: Body control, speed, and motor skills 
✦ **WITS**: Sensory perception, intelligence, and sanity 
✦ **EMPATHY**: Personal charisma and ability to manipulate others

In the step dice version of YZE, attributes are rated on a scale from A to D. Each attribute rating is connected to a specific die type. See the table below

**Starting Scores:** You start with a baseline of C in all four attributes. You may then make three increases, of one step each, up to A. You can increase any attributes you want. You can gain one extra increase by decreasing one attribute from C to D. **Die Size:** A term sometimes used in the step dice rules text is “die size.” This simply means the highest possible result on a particular die type. The die size of a D6 is 6, the die size of a D8 is 8, etc. 

| Attribute | Die Type | Die Size | Description   |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | ------------- |
| A         | D12      | 12       | Extraordinary | 
| B         | D10      | 10       | Capable              |
| C         | D8       | 8        | Average              |
| D         | D6       | 6        | Feeble              |

### Health & Resolve 
Your attributes determine how much damage and stress you can take before being broken and thus taken out of action. In some YZE games, this is measured by your Health and Re- solve scores. Read more about how those work in Chapter 4

**✦ Health:** Your starting Health equals the sum of the die size for your Strength and Agility scores divided by 4, rounding fractions up. 
**✦ Resolve:** Your starting Resolve equals the sum of the die size for your Wits and Empathy scores divided by 4, rounding up.

### Variations 
There are other ways to manage damage and trauma within the Year Zero Engine, which don’t require Health or Resolve scores at all. Two variants are described below: 
✦ **Just Health**: Some YZE games have only a Health rating, not Resolve. 
✦ **Attribute Damage**: You suffer damage directly on your attributes, reducing your effectiveness. You are broken if any attribute is reduced to zero. 
✦ **Conditions**: Each point of damage gives you a condition (page 21) and you are broken when you have suffered a set number of conditions.

### Skills 
Your skills are the knowledge and abilities you have acquired during your life. They are important, as they determine, along with your attributes, how effectively you can perform certain actions in the game. There are twelve basic skills in the YZE SRD, and they are all described in detail in Chapter 3. Some Year Zero Engine games have different or additional skills.

In the step dice version of YZE, skill levels are measured on a scale from A to D just like attributes. Just like for attributes, each skill level is connected to a specific die type. See the table below. 

**No Skill Level?** You can generally roll for a skill even if you have no level at all in that skill – in that case, only use the associated attribute for the skill in question. 

**Starting Skills:** Choose one B level skill, two C level skills, and three D level skills. Your B level skill must typically be one listed by your archetype. You can choose your C and D level skills freely.

| Skill Level | Die Type | Die Size | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| A | D12 | 12 | Elite |
| B | D10 | 10 | Veteran |
| C | D8 | 8 | Experienced |
| D | D6 | 6 | Novice |

### Specialties 
Specialties are tricks, moves and minor abilities that give you a small edge. In some Year Zero Engine games, they are instead called talents. Specialties are more narrow than skills and give you a way to fine-tune your character. You can typically pick one specialty when creating your character, but your archetype determines which specialties you can choose from. You can learn more specialties during the course of the game. You can find a few examples of specialties in Chapter 3 (page 8 and forward), but most specialties are tuned to the specific game and its setting. 

### Personality Traits
Year Zero Engine games use a variety of methods to give your PC unique personality traits beyond the numerical stats. Some examples follow below. PRIDE: Something specific that defines your character and makes them stand out. It can be an ability, an event in your past, or something else. Once per game session, you may check your Pride to get one automatic success in a dice roll. You must justify how your Pride helps you. 

**Weakness**: An Achilles heel that can get you into trouble somehow. Your weakness adds depth and personality to your character and can also be used by the GM to create challenges for you. Roleplaying according to your weakness gives you extra XP at the end of the session. 

**Dark Secret**: Something that you have experienced before the game begins that has left its mark on you or still threatens you in some way. Your Dark Secrets is primarily a tool for the GM to create stories with, but can also earn you extra XP you get after a game session. 

**Big Dream**: This is your PC’s main long-term goal in the game. During play, you will gain extra XP if you risk or sacrifice something significant to move closer to seeing your big dream realized. 

**Relationships**: Your relationship with each of the other PCs, described with a short sentence for each. Your relation- ships are mainly used by the GM to create interesting challenges for you in the game. 

**Buddy**: The PC in the group that you feel closest to. Making a sacrifice or taking a big risk for your Buddy will earn you extra XP

### Gear 
Many (but not all) Year Zero Engine games are focused on survival, and having the right gear will help you do that. You must write down all the items you are carrying. Write down one item per row in the Gear section on your character sheet. If it’s not listed on your sheet, you don’t have it with you. 

**Starting Gear**: Your archetype typically determines what gear you can choose from at the start of the game. Clothes and gear used to carry other gear does not count toward your encumbrance and does not need to be noted down.

#### Consumables 
A special category of items in the game are called consumables. It can be food, water, ammunition, arrows, torches, air supply, electric power or others – depending on the setting of the game. There are two main ways to manage consumables. 

**Tracking:** The obvious way to manage consumables is to simply track them on your character sheet. Write down every ration of food, arrow or bullet, and reduce the amount as they are used up. A ration of food, ten arrows, or 25 bullets typically count as ¼ of a regular item. 

**Supply Rolls:** To emulate the scarcity of consumables with- out tracking each and every unit, you can use supply rolls. For each consumable in the game, you have a Supply rating. A higher rating is better. For encumbrance, each consumable counts as one regular item no matter the Supply rating. At regular intervals (depending on the consumable in question), you need to make a supply roll. This means rolling a number of D6 equal to the current Supply rating – but never more than six dice. For each 1 rolled, the Supply rating is reduced by one. When the Supply rating reaches zero, you’re out of the consumable. If you want to give a consumable to another person, simply increase the recipient’s Supply rating as many steps as you decrease your own. 

### Experience 
The things you learn during the game are measured in Experience Points (XP). You receive XP after the end of each game session. Talk it through and let the whole group discuss what has happened. For each of the below questions that you can reply “yes” to, you get one XP:

✦ Did you participate in the game session? 
✦ Did you explore a new location? 
✦ Did you defeat one or more dangerous adversaries? 
✦ Did you overcome an obstacle without using force? 
✦ Did you act according to your weakness / dark secret / big dream / relationships (page 6)? 
✦ Did you perform another extraordinary action of some kind? 
✦ Specific games can award XP for other actions as well. 

The GM has the final word when it comes to how much XP each character should get. 

#### Spending XP 
You can use your XP to improve your skills and specialties, or to learn new ones. You can only spend XP when your PC gets a chance to rest, or between game sessions. 

**Skills:** To increase a skill level by one step costs a number of XP indicated in the tables on page 7. You can only increase a skill level one step at a time. Learning a new skill (at skill level 1/D) costs 5 XP. 
In addition, to raise a skill level or gain a new skill, you must have used the skill and succeeded at least once since your last increase. Make a mark by the skill on the character sheet to indicate this. Only meaningful skill rolls where something is truly at stake count for this purpose. The GM has final say. As an alternative to making a skill roll, you can be instructed for one shift by a teacher with a higher skill level than you. 

**Specialties:** Learning a specialty always costs 10 XP, but also requires a teacher – a PC or NPC who already knows the specialty – instructing you for at least one shift. After the shift, the teacher makes a Persuasion roll. If they fail, you learn nothing this shift. You keep your XP and the teacher can try again in another shift. 

| Target Level | XP Cost |
| ---- | ---- |
| D | 5 |
| C | 10 |
| B | 15 |
| A | 20 |
### Personality Traits 
After any session, you may change personality traits such as your pride, weakness, dark secret, big dream, and relationships. Try to connect the change to something that has happened during the course of the game.

# 3) Skills & Specialties

Roleplaying is a conversation. The Gamemaster describes the scene, you describe how your PCs behave, the GM describes how any NPCs react, you reply, and it goes back and forth. That is how the story is told and progresses. But sooner or later, a decisive situation will arise, a point of no return, a conflict that conversation alone cannot resolve. Then it’s time to break out the dice and use one of your skills.

## Roll the Dice

There are twelve core skills in total in the Year Zero Engine, and they are all described later in this chapter. Each skill is connected to one of the four attributes: Strength, Agility, Wits, and Empathy

To roll for a skill in the step dice version, grab two dice – one for your skill level and another for the base attribute that is connected to the skill. These two dice are called your base dice. The type of base dice to roll depends on your levels in the skill and attribute (page 5). Then roll your two base dice together. 

**Success:** To succeed with your action, you must roll 6 or higher on at least one base die used in the roll. A roll of 6 or higher is called a success, and is marked in the rules with the eye symbol. A roll of 10 or higher on a single die (only possi- ble with a D10 or D12) counts as two successes. 

**No Skill?** If you don’t have the skill required for the particular action you want to perform, you can roll anyway – simply roll the base die for your attribute alone. 

**Gear:** Gear can give positive modifiers (page 11) or even additional dice to roll.

### Multiple Successes
If you roll two or more successes, you reach your stated goal, but also gain some additional bonus effect, depending on the situation and the skill used. In combat, extra successes can increase the damage done. For other skills, you can suggest a bonus effect yourself. The GM has final say. Some suggestions: 
✦ You act quickly. 
✦ You act quietly. 
✦ You help another character. 
✦ You impress someone. 
✦ You discover something unexpected. 

**More Successes:** Rolling three or even more successes generally only matters in combat, where each additional will increase the damage done by one point.

### The Art of Failure 
If you roll no success, something goes wrong. For some reason, you failed to achieve your goal. Feel free to elaborate on why with the help of the GM. They might even let a failed roll have further consequences to move the story forward in a dramatic way. Failure must not stop the story completely. Even when you fail, there must be a way forward – perhaps at the cost of additional time, risk, or resources, but still a way. The GM has the final say regarding the consequences of failure in a particular situation. You have one last chance if you really need to succeed – you can push the roll. 

**Combat:** In combat, the GM doesn’t have to give every failure too much of a consequence. The fact that your attack missed is usually enough, as it is now your enemy’s turn to retaliate. The GM can of course penalize you with extra consequences in combat as well – maybe your missed shot hits someone else instead?

### Different Colors 
Whether a certain die you have rolled originates from your attribute, your skill, or your gear, may be important. For that reason, you should use dice of three different colors. The dice from attributes are called Base Dice, the dice from skills are called Skill Dice, and the dice from gear are called Gear Dice.

## Prayer

When your need is most dire, you can pray to the Icons for help. This means you get to reroll all dice not showing sixes. Which Icon you pray to depends on the skill you just tested – see table 3.2. The prayer doesn’t count towards your actions in the turn (see Chapter 5) and takes no time to perform – you just open yourself up to the energy of the Icons. But this doesn’t come without risk, see below. You will usually only pray to the Icons when your roll has failed, but you could pray even if there were sixes in your initial roll, to get more sixes and unlock more bonus effects. You can only pray to the Icons when testing a skill, not for any other roll. You can only pray once for each roll.

### Preparatory Prayer and Chapels
If you make time for preparatory prayers to a specific Icon before lunging into the fray, you get a +1 modifier to rerolls when you pray to that same Icon anytime later during the session. If the prayer takes place in a chapel, your modifier becomes +2. This is in effect for the rest of the session, but only when you pray to that specific Icon (see table 3.2). 

There are two ways to acquire Conditions. You may have to choose one when pushing a roll, and can also get them as a consequence of failing a test. Acquiring Conditions means that your player character has been negatively affected.
Conditions are divided into two types: physical and mental. Physical Conditions are linked to
Physique and Precision, and mental ones to Logic and Empathy. 

Physical Conditions include: **Exhausted**,
**Battered**, and **Wounded**, while mental Conditions include **Angry**, **Frightened**, and **Hopeless**.
While you are suffering from a Condition you get 1 fewer die for all rolls that are linked to either physical or mental attributes. Also worth noting is that Conditions stack, meaning that two Conditions of the same type will subtract two dice from your dice pool. No matter how many Conditions you have accumulated, you may always roll at least one die.
Conditions can be healed through rest and other activities, which is described further in chapter 5.
When you already have three Conditions of the same type and acquire a fourth one, you become Broken. This means that you are seriously injured, temporarily insane, or otherwise worn down. You may not perform any actions, physical or mental. In addition, a Broken player character also sustains ancritical injury (see page 64).

## Pushing Your Roll 

Your initial skill roll reflects a safe and controlled action. If you fail your initial roll, or if you want additional successes, you can lean into the action, giving it everything you’ve got, pushing yourself to the limit. This is called pushing the roll, and lets you re-roll any dice that don’t show the result of 1. A base die showing a 1 is called a bane and can never be re-rolled when pushing. After a push, you cannot change back to the previous result. All dice count after the push, even any dice you didn’t re-roll. 

### Cost of Pushing 
Pushing always comes with a risk or a cost. These vary greatly depending on the game and the version of the YZE you use. The push mechanic is generally the best place to highlight the core themes of an YZE game. Several options follow below. 

**Damage & Stress:** After a pushed roll, you immediately suffer one point of damage (if you rolled for Strength or Agility) or one point of stress (if you rolled for Wits or Empathy) for each bane (1) rolled on your base dice. If this damage or stress breaks you, this happens after the action is resolved. As an option, when using a weapon or a tool of some sort, the tool suffers damage (or reduced durability) instead of you.

Note that this pushing version works best in the step dice version of YZE, as having more dice to roll in a dice pool will increase the risk of suffering damage or stress when pushing. 

**Attribute Damage:** For each bane (1) rolled on your base dice after a pushed roll, you immediately suffer one point of damage directly on the attribute rolled for. Only the base dice from the attribute count, not base dice from skills or gear. For this reason, you should preferably have base dice of separate colors for attributes, skills, and gear. For each bane rolled for a piece of gear in a pushed roll, the bonus from the gear is re- duced by one step. If this damage or stress breaks you or your gear, this happens after the action is resolved. Note that this pushing version requires attribute damage (page 20). In some YZE games using attribute damage, rolling banes on base dice can also have positive effects – it gives you the force of will required to use special abilities like magic (see Chapter 5). For every point of attribute damage you suffer from pushing, you gain a Willpower Point (WP). The WP are required to use your special abilities. 

**Stress Dice:** When you push a roll, you immediately take one stress point. When making skill rolls, including the immediate re-roll when pushing, add a number of stress dice to your roll equal to your current amount of stress points. Stress dice are D6s that are added to your roll and sixes on them count as successes, meaning the built-up stress actually increases your chances to succeed, as it makes you more sharp and alert. However, if you roll a bane on one or more stress dice (even in the initial roll, without pushing), you trigger a roll on a panic table or some other unwanted effect. You can find a sample panic table on page 10. Stress is typically relieved – all stress points removed – after a stretch of rest in a (reasonably) safe location. The pushing version works very well in horror-oriented games. 

**Conditions:** When pushing a roll, you immediately suffer a condition of some sort, such as Exhausted, Angry, or Scared. For each condition you haven, you suffer a negative modifi- cation on some or all skill rolls. Conditions also work as cues for roleplaying. This push version is suitable for rules-light narrative games. See [[6) Magic#Conditions]] for more on conditions. 

**Doom Points:** Every time you push a roll, the GM gets one Doom Point. The Doom Points can be used by the GM to trigger misfortunes or obstacles for you at any time, such as your weapon misfiring, you dropping something, or your enemy getting reinforcements. Note that the list of what Doom Points can be used for must be very clear and known to all players, as the line otherwise will be blurry between Doom Points and what the GM does anyway to challenge your character.

### Passive Rolls
You can only push skill rolls when you actively perform an action. When passive or unaware, for example when rolling Observation to see if you spot a sneaking enemy, you cannot push the roll

### Only Once 
You can only push a skill roll once. If you don’t succeed on your second try, you are stuck dealing with the consequences.

>[!important] What Pushing Means 
>How a pushed roll plays out in story terms depends on what skill you are using. It can take the form of a great physical exertion, total mental focus, or emotional strain


## Only One Chance

As a rule, you only have one chance to succeed with any action. Once you have rolled the dice – and pushed the roll – you may not roll again to achieve the same goal. You need to try something different or wait until the circumstances have changed in a substantial way. Or let another player character try. This rule does not apply to combat, where you can attack the same enemy multiple times. 

## Modifiers 

Sometimes, external factors help you to succeed. Such modifiers will give you additional base dice to roll (in the dice pool version) or step your base dice to bigger dice (in the step dice version). Other times, something hampers your action. This removes base dice from your pool (dice pool version) or downsteps your base dice (step dice). You can get such modifiers to skill rolls in several different ways: specialties, the difficulty of the action itself, and help from others.

A +1 modifier means upgrading a base die one step, a +2 modifier means upgrading two steps, and so on. A −1 modifier means downgrading a base die one step, −2 means two steps down, and so on. Several modifiers can apply to the same roll, and they are cumulative. 
When stepping up and down, always try to balance your dice as much as possible – i.e. step up a lower base die first, and downstep a higher base die. You can never go above two D12s, no matter what modifiers you have. To downstep past two D6s, remove one die. You can never go below one D6. If you lack a skill level and start with just a single base die, step up by adding a D6 (as one step up) and step it up further as needed. 

### Difficulty 
Normally, the GM doesn’t assess how difficult an action is. You only roll dice in challenging situations – period. But sometimes, the GM might want to underscore that external factors either help or hinder an action. Use the adjacent table for guidance.

| Difficulty | Modifier |
| ---- | ---- |
| Trivial | +3 |
| Simple | +2 |
| Easy | +1 |
| Average | 0 |
| Demanding | -1 |
| Hard | -2 |
| Formidable | -3 |

**Specific Modifiers:** There are also cases when modifications are imposed by the rules, like when you aim carefully with a ranged weapon, shoot at long distance, or if you’re in a bad negotiation position when you attempt to Persuade someone. Some specialties also give you a positive modifier in certain situations.

### Advantage/Disadvantage 
In the step dice version of YZE, you can use an advantage/ disadvantage rule instead of numerical modifiers to a skill roll. It’s faster but less detailed, and thus works best in a rules light system. For this system to work, all PCs need a minimum skill level of D in all skills. To use this system, consider any positive modifier (regardless of its magnitude) in this SRD an advan-tage, and any negative modifier a disadvantage. 

**Advantage:** When you have an advantage, you add a third base die to your roll, of the same type as your lower die. This means you roll three dice instead of two, counting all success- es. You can push the roll normally. 

**Disadvantage:** When you have a disadvantage, you must remove your lower base die. This means you’ll be rolling just one die instead of two. You can push the roll normally. 

**Cumulative:** If you have both an advantage and a dis- advantage, they cancel each other out. If you have several advantages or disadvantages, one advantage cancels out one disadvantage.

**Just One:** After balancing advantages against disadvantages as per above, you can never roll for more than one advantage or disadvantage – if you have several, it still counts as just a single one.

## Help From Others

Other PCs or NPCs can help you succeed at a skill roll. This must be declared before you roll your dice. It must also make sense in the story – the individuals helping you must be physically present and have the capacity to support your action. The GM has final say.

For each person helping you, you get a +1 modifier. No more than three people can help you with a single roll, meaning your maximum modifier from getting help is +3. In combat, helping counts as the same type of action as the one you are supporting (fast or slow). NPCs can help each other in the same way as player characters. Letting NPCs act in groups instead of individually is of- ten an easy way to manage large numbers of NPCs in combat

## Parallel Actions 

When you are doing things at the same time, you cannot help each other. If all of you are trying to sneak past someone or avoid sinking into a swamp, each of you must pass your own test without assistance from the others. However, some skills allow a character whose test is extra successful to give successes to others (see Extra Successes), and help them that way instead.

## Opposed Rolls

Sometimes, rolling a success isn’t enough to succeed with your skill roll. In some cases, you must beat your opponent in an opposed roll. To win an opposed roll, you must roll more successes than your adversary. Every success rolled by your adversary eliminates one of your successes. Only you (the active party) can push your roll – and you can decide to do so even after your opponent rolls. 
Sometimes you and your adversary roll for different skills, sometimes the same. Opposed can be used when you roll Persuasion versus Insight to influence someone who is actively trying to resist you, or Stealth versus Observation to move undetected past a vigilant guard. The GM can also use opposed rolls in any case when they deem it appropriate. 

Ties: If you and your opponent roll the same number of successes, the result is a tie. Typically, your action will fail if you roll a tie as the active party in an opposed roll, but in some cases, ties have specific effects. If a tie needs to be broken, re-roll the opposed roll to determine the outcome.

> [!note] NPCs and Skills 
> Non-Player Characters use skills in the same way as player characters. The GM rolls dice for them, and they can push their rolls just like PCs can. But the GM only has to roll for actions that affect a PC directly – for example, if the NPC is attacking a player character or is attempting to save them. When an NPC performs an action that does not directly affect a PC, the GM can simply decide what happens, without rolling dice.


## The Skills

This section describes the twelve core skills of the Year Zero Engine.

#### Force (Strength) 
When something heavy or solid blocks your way and you need to lift, push, or break it, roll for Force. Use this skill for any feat of strength

#### Melee (Strength)
Sometimes, you need to fight for your life, hand-to-hand with your opponent. Roll for this skill when you attack someone or defend yourself using only your body or a melee weapon. Read more about close combat and damage in Chapter 4.

#### Stamina (Strength)
When your physical endurance or vigor is tested, roll for Stamina. For example, this skill is used to survive under water or to resist a deadly poison. You also roll Stamina to stay alive when you have suffered a lethal critical injury.

#### Marksmanship (Agility)
Use the Marksmanship skill to fire all types of range weapons. Read more about ranged combat in Chapter 4.

#### Mobility (Agility)
Roll for Mobility when you want to perform any action that requires speed or motor control – be it a risky climb, a dangerous jump, or a foot chase after a fleeing enemy (page 27).

#### Stealth (Agility)
Roll for Stealth when trying to sneak past someone, staying undetected, or picking someone’s pocket. If your opponent is actively looking for you, it’s an opposed roll against their Observation. If not, it’s just a straight skill roll. Each of the following external factors gives you a +1 modifier to the roll:
- You blend into your surroundings.
- The area is dark or dimly lit.
- The area is crowded or noisy.
- Your opponent is distracted by something.

Each of the following factors gives you a −1 modifier to the roll:
- You stand out against the surroundings.
- There is nothing to hide behind.

#### Crafting (Wits)
The Crafting skill is primarily used to repair broken gear or building new items, but it can also be used to understand or operate mechanical constructions. Repairing a broken item typically takes a shift of work (see Gear on page 11). The exact uses of this skill vary depending on the specific game setting.

#### Observation (Wits)
The Observation skill can be used to examine an area to find useful information or to spot something or someone from a distance. When the GM calls for it, you can make a passive roll for this skill to detect an approaching threat in time. When examining an area, the GM can give you a positive modifier if your description of where you are searching is very precise, or even let you succeed without a roll.

#### Survival (Wits)
Year Zero Engine games often take place in harsh and dangerous environments. Roll for Survival when you’re in a hazardous environment of some kind, be it extreme heat and cold, sandstorms, acid rain, or other forms of extreme weather, and need to figure out a way to stay alive. Read more in Chapter 6.

#### Healing (Empathy)
In many YZE games, your PC risks getting hurt. This is when the Healing skill is useful. It can be used to get a broken character back on their feet or even save their life if they suffered a critical injury. Read more on page 22.

#### Insight (Empathy)
This skill represents the ability to read other people and see through lies. Roll for Insight to assess an NPC’s mood. If you succeed, the GM must reveal the NPC’s current, most powerful emotion – hate, fear, contempt, love, etc. If you roll several successes, you can also determine if an NPC is lying – but not exactly what they are lying about or what the truth is. The Insight skill can also be used in opposed rolls to resist Persuasion (below).

#### Persuasion (Empathy)
Sometimes, you can make things go your way without resorting to violence. Instead, you trick or convince your opponents without drawing your weapon. For this, you use the Persuasion skill. If your opponent is actively trying to resist you, it’s an opposed roll against their Insight. If not, it’s a straight roll. Before you roll, you must state the stakes of the roll – what you want to achieve. What you ask of your opponent must be within reason. No NPC will agree to do anything you want or act directly against their own interests, no matter how good your roll is. Conversely, you don’t need to roll for simple requests that your opponent has no reason to resist. The GM has the final say on when Persuasion rolls can or need to be used.

Being Persuaded: Generally, Persuasion is only used against NPCs, not PCs. When NPCs or other PCs try to talk you into something, it’s up to you how you react.

Interrogation: When you interrogate a prisoner to gain information, roll against their Stamina instead of their Insight. You get a +1 modifier to your roll for your opponent being held captive. As opposed to normal persuasion, interrogation can be used against PCs – actually forcing you to disclose information whether you as a player want to or not.

Persuading a Group: When you want to Persuade a whole group, you usually address the group’s leader or spokesperson.

>[!important] Negotiating Position 
>Your chances of Persuading someone are affected by your negotiating position. Each of the following factors gives you +1 modifier to the roll: 
>✦ Your request doesn’t cost your opponent anything. 
>✦ Your opponent has suffered damage or stress. 
>✦ Your opponent is in custody or held captive by you. 
>✦ You have helped your opponent previously. 
>✦ You present your case very well (determined by the GM).
>
>Each of the following factors gives you a −1 modifier to the roll: 
>✦ Your opponent must take a serious risk or make a sacrifice to help you. 
>✦ Your opponent has nothing to gain by helping you. 
>✦ You are held captive by your opponent. 
>✦ You are having trouble hearing or understanding each other.


## Specialties

While attributes and skills give you the broad strokes of your competency, specialties represent specific areas of expertise. Specialties are unique tricks and talents that give you an edge and keep your adversaries guessing. 
You typically start the game with just one or a few specialties, with your choice limited by your archetype. You can learn more specialties during the game (page 7), without being limited by your archetype. 

This section includes a limited number of general specialties, as the selection of specialties in a specific game are closely tailored to its setting and theme. The specialties listed here should be considered examples only.

| Speciality | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Creature Bond** | Your connection to mystical creatures goes beyond the ordinary. Gain an intuitive understanding of their needs and emotions. Gain a +1 modifier when using Empathy to establish a deeper bond and unlock hidden potential in an animal, whether mundane or mythic. |
| **Ancient Lorekeeper** | Your knowledge of history and lore is unparalleled. Gain a +1 modifier to Observation when deciphering ancient texts or uncovering historical mysteries. |
| **Sandstrider** | Master the art of traversing the desert with unparalleled ease. Gain a +1 modifier to Agility and Survival Instincts rolls when navigating the harsh conditions of the desert. |
| **Veiled Shadows** | Embrace the shadows and become one with darkness. Gain a +1 modifier to Shadowcraft and Observation rolls when concealed or moving stealthily in dimly lit environments. |
| **Mystic Artisan** | Fuse magical essence with your craftsmanship. Gain a +1 modifier to Artistry rolls when creating enchanted items or imbuing your creations with mystical properties. |
| **Whispering Winds** | Develop an uncanny sensitivity to imminent danger. Gain a +1 modifier to Observation if you attempt to sense a threats. You may also use Empathy instead of Wits if appropriate. |
| **Celestial Harmony** | Attune yourself to the celestial energies, enhancing your healing abilities. Gain a +1 modifier to Healing and Empathy rolls when tending to wounds or providing emotional support. |
| **Charismatic Enchanter** | Captivate audiences with mystical charm. Gain a +1 modifier to Inspiration rolls when utilizing your presence to influence emotions. |
| **Elemental Affinity** (Magic Specialty) | Harness the power of the elements. Gain a +1 modifier to rolls related to a specific elemental discipline, such as fire, water, air, or earth. |
| **Astral Insight** (Magic Specialty) | Peer into the astral realm, unveiling hidden truths. Gain a +1 modifier to rolls related to divination and insights into cosmic mysteries. |
| **Sandswept Illusionist** (Magic Specialty) | Master the art of illusions with a touch of desert magic. Gain a +1 modifier to Stealth and Deception rolls when employing illusions to mislead foes. |

#### Bodyguard
If someone within Short range of you is hit by an attack, you can dive in to take the hit. Roll for Mobility. It doesn’t count as an action in combat. If you roll one or more successes, you take the hit instead of your friend. You can push the roll.

#### Compassion
You can push any skill roll based on Empathy twice, not just once like other characters.

#### Fast Reflexes
You can draw two initiative cards instead of one during the initiative draw. Choose the one you want to use.

#### Field Surgeon
You know the delicate art of stopping a wound from bleeding or treating grave injuries. You get a +1 modifier to Healing when treating someone who is about to die from a critical injury.

#### Flyweight
When you block in close combat, you can use Agility instead of Strength.

#### Gut Feeling
You have a knack for sensing when trouble is coming your way. You can roll for Observation using Empathy instead of Wits to detect an approaching threat.

#### Hardened
Your maximum Resolve score is increased by 1. You can take this specialty up to three times.

#### Hard Hitter
You get a +1 modification to Melee Combat if you sacrifice your fast action in the round.

#### Inquisitive
You can push any skill roll based on Wits twice, not just once like other characters.

#### Killer
You know where to strike to make your enemy fall and not get up. Ever. When your enemy sustains a critical injury, you may roll twice and choose the result you want.

#### Lucky
No matter what horrible situations you end up in, you always seem to make it out unscathed. When you suffer a critical injury, you get to re-roll the dice and choose the result that you prefer.

# 4) Combat

Combat is deadly in most Year Zero Engine games. Before you enter a fight, you should always ask yourself: Is it worth it?

## Maps & Zones 

A violent conflict is typically played out using a map of the location where your characters happen to find themselves fighting for their lives. The map is divided into zones. A zone is typically a room, a corridor, or an area of ground. How big a zone is varies – from a few steps across up to about 25 meters. A zone is gen- erally smaller in a cramped environment than in open terrain. In pre-made scenario material, zones are usually indicated on a location map. In random encounters created on the fly, the GM can make a quick sketch of the area or simply describe it. 

PLAYING WITHOUT MAPS Although maps can be useful, you can always choose not to use them and let certain conflicts play out only in the “theater of the mind.” This can be a good solution in close quarters conflicts between a small number of combatants. 

### Zone Features 
Zones can have various features, which affect actions per- formed within them. Here are some examples: 

**Cluttered:** The zone is covered by dense undergrowth or filled with debris of some sort. You must roll for Mobility when you move into the zone. Failure means you manage to get into the zone, but you fall down. 

**Dimly Lit:** The zone is dimly lit. Observation rolls in the zone get a −2 modifier. Ranged attacks into the zone also suffer a −2 modifier, and can’t pass through the zone.

**Cramped:** A crawlspace or narrow tunnel. In a cramped zone, you can only crawl, not run. You also cannot move or shoot past individuals next to you against targets behind them. 

### Borders & Line of Sight 
The border between two adjacent zones can be open or blocked by a wall. A blocked border can have a door or a hatch, as indicated by the map, allowing movement between the two zones.

Open borders don’t block vision or movement. A blocked border generally blocks line of sight even if there is a door or hatch in it – unless you’re actively standing by the doorway and peeking through. 

### Range Categories 
The distance between you and your opponents is divided into five range categories. See the adjacent table.

| Range | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Engaged | Right next to you |
| Short | A few meters away, in the same zone as you |
| Medium | Up to 25 meters away, in an adjacent zone |
| Long | Up to about one hundred meters (four zones) away |
| Extreme | Up to about one kilometer |

## Rounds & Initiative 

> [!warning] One Single Initiative
> I'd like to consider making the players all go at the same time, allowing them to all make their actions in any order. So initiative would go, all the players, then the bad guys. 
> [Group Initiative](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/yjb8lm/the_case_for_group_initiative_why_you_should_let/)

Combat is played out in rounds, each roughly 5–10 seconds long. When combat begins, the first step is to determine who has the initiative. Do this before anyone rolls dice for an action. 

### Drawing Initiative 
Grab ten cards, numbered 1 through 10. A suit of any normal deck of cards works fine if you remove the face cards and count the ace as 1. 
Each player taking part in the conflict, either voluntarily or involuntarily, draws a card and the GM draws one card for each NPC (or group). This is called drawing the initiative. The number on the card determines the order in which you act in the conflict. 
Participants act in order from lowest to highest number, beginning with card #1, until everyone has taken their turn. Place your initiative card by your character sheet, so every- one can see in which order you all act. The GM places their initiative card(s) in front of them. 
When all the participants in the combat have acted once, the round is over, and a new round begins. The round order remains the same throughout the whole conflict – drawing initiative is only done once, at the start of the first round.

### Surprise 
If you initiate combat with an attack that the GM deems fully surprising, you get to choose any initiative you want instead of drawing a random card. All other combatants – including oth- ers on your side – draw initiative normally. Also see Ambushes (page 17). 

### Exchanging Initiative 
During a fight, you can exchange your initiative card – and thus your initiative – with another player character or NPC, whose turn has not yet come up in the current round (if such a character exists). This must be declared on your turn, before you perform any action. The other character cannot resist this exchange, and must take their turn immediately. A character is not allowed to immediately exchange their initiative when just given a new one. They may, however, exchange this new initiative in the following Round.

>[!note] Hidden Initiative 
>As an alternative rule to create more uncertainty, you can keep initiative cards secret. The GM then calls out initiative numbers, starting at #1, and each combatant shows their card and per- forms their actions once their number comes up. In this variant, the initiative must be drawn again at the start of each round.

### Your Turn
The point in the initiative order at which you act is called your turn. The phrase “your next turn” means the next upcoming point in the initiative order at which you normally act, whether that happens to be in the current round or the next round (if your turn in the current Round has already passed). The phrase “your previous turn” means your latest previous point in the initiative order, whether it was in the current round or the previous round. 

### NPC Initiative 
For a group of NPCs with identical stats, the GM can, if they want, draw one initiative card for the group instead of one per individual. All the NPCs in that group act at the same point in the round order. In what order they act individually within the group is up to the GM.

>[!question] Mark Your Actions 
>Because helping and reactive actions occur out of turn, it can be hard to keep track of how many actions the combatants have performed. A tip is to keep track of this by turning the initiative card 90 degrees for every performed action. Turn it to the left for a fast action and to the right for a slow action, and all the way around 180 degrees once both actions in the turn are used up. All actions are refreshed at the start of each round.

## Slow & Fast Actions

On your turn, you can perform one slow action and one fast action, or two fast actions. See the lists of typical slow and fast actions on page 16. 

**Free Actions**: Dropping to the ground or shouting a few words are called free actions – they don’t count toward your two actions for the round, but you can only do them on your own turn. 

### Describe Your Actions 
When it’s your turn to act, simply state which actions you wish to perform and roll dice if needed to see if you are successful. Some actions will give your opponent the opportunity to perform a reactive action that breaks the turn order. 

### Helping Others 
If you wish to help another player character or NPC perform an action (page 11), it costs you one action of the same kind (slow or fast). You must state you are trying to help someone before any dice are rolled. Helping others occurs out of turn, i.e. it breaks the initiative order in the round.

### Slow Actions
| Action | Prerequisite | Skill |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Crawl | You are prone | - |
| Close combat attack | - | Melee |
| Shoot ranged weapon | Ranged weapon | Marksmanship |
| Reload | Firearm | - |
| First aid | Broken or dying victim | Healing |
| Persuade | Your opponent can hear you | Persuasion |
### Fast Actions
| Fast Action | Prerequisite | Skill |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Run | No Engaged enemy | Mobility (in cluttered zone) |
| Move through door/hatch | - | - |
| Get up | You are prone | - |
| Draw weapon | - | - |
| Block attack | Attacked in close combat | Melee |
| Grapple attack | You've grappled an opponent | Melee |
| Retreat | Engaged enemy | Mobility |
| Aim | Ranged weapon | - |
| Seek cover | Cover in same zone | - |
| Steer | Mount | Mobility |
| Saddle up onto a Mount | Mount | Mobility |
| Use item | Varies | Varies |
## Movement

To move during combat, you can spend a fast action to move from one zone to a neighbouring zone or between Short and Engaged range from an enemy or PC in the same zone you are already in. No roll is required to move, unless it’s into a Cluttered zone. 

**Crawling**: Moving while prone, i.e. crawling, is a slow action. That means you can’t crawl twice in the same round. In a Cramped zone, crawling is the only movement possible. 

**Close Combat:** If you have an active enemy at Engaged range, you can’t just walk away from them. Instead, you must retreat (page 17). 

**Doors & Hatches:** You can open an unlocked door or hatch with a fast action. A locked door or hatch can be broken down. A typical wooden door or hatch can take 5 points of damage before it gives in. More sturdy doors require more force, and also have an armor rating (page 21). 

**Chases:** In chases, on foot or using vehicles, movement is also managed differently. See page 27. 

**Vehicles:** Movement for vehicles is handled with special rules. Read more on page 26. 

### Retreat 
If you have an active enemy at Engaged range and there is no barrier between you, you must make a Mobility roll to move away from your adversary. If you fail, you still move but your enemy gets an immediate, free close combat attack against you. The free attack occurs out of turn order and it doesn’t count toward their actions in the round. You cannot block it. 

## Ambushes & Sneak Attacks 

The key to winning a conflict is often attacking when your enemy least expects it. You can achieve this in several different ways. 

**Sneak Attack:** When you sneak up on someone undetected and perform an attack, it is called a sneak attack. First you make a Stealth roll. Moving close enough to attack in melee combat (Engaged range) gives you a −2 modifier. If you fail, the enemy notices you – draw initiative. 
If you succeed, your attack counts as surprising, which means that you can choose any initiative card you want. For a close combat sneak attack, you also get a +3 modifier, and the target cannot block the attack. Sneak attacks are always performed individually, by one attacker against one target. 

**Ambush:** A special kind of sneak attack is an ambush – lying in wait for an enemy and attacking as it passes by. In this case each victim makes an Observation roll to spot the ambush, with a −2 modifier if the attackers are well prepared. All those who fail get the bottom cards (counting from #10 and up), randomly drawn.

## Close Combat

When you attack in close combat, use the Melee skill. Close combat happens at Engaged range from your target. There can be no barrier between you and your target. If there is, you must first cross the barrier. Cover has no effect against close combat attacks. 

**Damage:** If your roll succeeds, you hit your adversary and inflict your weapon’s base damage rating on them. Each extra success will increase the damage by 1. 

**Stance:** If you are prone, your close combat attacks get a −2 modifier. Getting up is a fast action. Close combat attacks against a prone target get a +2 modifier. 

**Defenseless Target:** If you attack a defenseless or unaware target, you get a +3 modifier. This is not further increased if the target is prone. 

### Special Attacks 
In close combat, you might want to achieve a different result than simply hurting your opponent. This must be declared before you roll any dice, and it can only be done if you fight unarmed. 

✦ You wrestle a hand-held item from your opponent’s grasp. You can keep the item or throw it into an adjacent zone as part of the attack. 
✦ You trip your opponent to the ground. 
✦ You push your opponent to Short range. 
✦ You pin your enemy in a tight clinch. See Grappling, below. 

**Grappling:** If you successfully grapple your opponent, both you and your opponent fall to the ground. The opponent drops any weapon they were holding, and cannot move. The only action they can perform is an attempt to break free – which is a slow action that succeeds if the opponent wins an opposed Melee roll against you. While you are grappling, the only action you can perform (apart from releasing your op- ponent) is a grapple attack. This works as a normal unarmed attack, but is a fast action and cannot be blocked. 

**Diving Blow:** If you, in a single round, first move into Engaged range of an enemy and then attack them with an unarmed blow, you get a +2 modifier to the attack. This is called a diving blow. If the attack hits, you inflict damage normally, and both you and the target fall prone. If the attack fails, only you fall to the ground.

### Blocking 
When an enemy attacks you in close combat, you can roll for Melee to block their attack to avoid being hit. This is a fast action. You must declare that you are attempting to block the attack before the attacker rolls for their strike. This effective- ly turns the attack into an opposed roll (page 11). Every success you roll eliminates one from the attacker’s roll. Excess successes have no effect. 

**Blocking Unarmed:** If you are unarmed, you can only block unarmed attacks from other humanoids. To block an armed close combat attack, or an attack by an animal or beast of some type, you need to wield some kind of sturdy weapon or tool. 

**Actions:** Blocking breaks the turn order, but it does count against your two available actions in the round (one slow and one fast). For every block you perform, you get one less action when it is your turn, and once you have used both your actions during the round for blocks, you can no longer block further attacks. All actions are refreshed at the beginning of each new round. You can save unused actions to block later in the round, but never from one round to the next.

### Close Combat Modifiers
| Factor | Modifier |
| ---- | ---- |
| Attacker prone | -2 |
| Target prone | +2 |
| Defenceless target | +3 |
| Diving blow | +2 |

## Ranged Combat 

To attack someone with a hand-held ranged weapon, roll for Marksmanship, except for thrown weapons, which use Mobil- ity. To draw a weapon is a fast action, while firing a weapon is a slow action. 

**Damage:** If your attack succeeds, you hit your target and inflict your weapon’s base damage rating on them. Each extra success increases the damage by 1. 

**Range:** The weapons tables indicate the range of each weap- on, i.e. the maximum range category at which the weapon can be used. The farther away your target is, the harder it is to hit. At Medium range you get a −1 modification, and at Long range you get −2. At Engaged range you get −3, because it’s hard to draw a bead on an opponent that close. You don’t get this penalty if you fire at a defenseless or unwitting enemy – instead, you get a +3 modification. 

**Target Size:** Firing at a large target, such as a vehicle, gives a +2 modifier to the attack. Firing at a small object, such a hatch or a hand-held item, gives a −2 modifier.

**Unseen Target:** If you can’t see your target (because of darkness or cover) but still have a good idea of where they are, you can still fire, but with a −2 modifier. 

### Aimed Fire
If you take your time to aim carefully before squeezing the trigger, you get a +2 to your attack roll. Aiming is a fast action. If you do anything else except shoot your weapon after you have aimed, or if you are hurt, you lose the effect of the aim and you need to spend another fast action to aim again. 

### Ranged Fire Modifiers
| Factor           | Modifier  |
|------------------|-----------|
| Aimed shot       | +2        |
| Target Engaged   | −3/+3     |
| Short range      | —         |
| Medium range     | −1        |
| Long range       | −2        |
| Extreme range    | −3        |
| Large target     | +2        |
| Small target     | −2        |
| Dim light        | −1        |
| Darkness         | -2         |

### Ammunition
Ammunition for firearms can be handled in different ways, depending on the technological level of the game setting and level of complexity you want in your game. You can count ev- ery bullet, handle ammunition via supply rolls (page 7), or use the more extensive ammo dice system (see the sidebar on page 19). Simple single-shot weapons need to be reloaded after each shot. Reloading a firearm is a slow action. 

### Bows & Slingshots 
Bows and slingshots cannot be “reloaded” as such – instead, you need to spend a fast action to prepare the weapon by nocking an arrow or placing a stone in your sling. Once you have readied your weapon, you can’t do anything except shoot or aim (above) – if you do anything else, you must prepare the weapon again before you can shoot. Crossbows don’t need to be prepared in this manner. They can be carried loaded as a firearm, and loading it is a slow action

### Overwatch 
As a fast action, you can assume an overwatch position in a specified direction, as long as you have a ranged weapon and no enemies within Engaged range. This means that you aim in the specified direction and are ready to shoot. Between the time you assume the overwatch position and your time to act in the next round, you can fire your weapon against a target in the chosen direction. You can fire whenever you want in the turn order, and your shot is resolved before all other actions – even if they are already declared. For example, if an enemy in the direction you are aiming declares that they want to fire a weapon, you can shoot first. The enemy is not allowed to change their attack after your overwatch attack.

Firing when in overwatch position counts as a normal attack (a slow action). Therefore, you must save your slow ac- tion in the round for any overwatch attack you want to make. If both you and an enemy assume overwatch positions against each other, and both choose to fire against each other, then an opposed Marksmanship roll determines which attack goes first. This roll does not count as an action for either of you. 

**Losing Overwatch:** You keep your overwatch position until you break it, or any of the following occurs: 
✦ You perform any action other than overwatch fire. 
✦ You are attacked in close combat. 
✦ You suffer damage

## Weapons

Using a weapon will greatly improve your effectiveness in combat. The table below describes a few typical weapons of various types. Which exact weapons to include in your game depends greatly on the setting of the game. The features used in the weapon tables are explained below. 

**Grip:** Indicates if you need one or two hands to wield the weapon. A two-handed weapon can’t be combined with a shield, and some critical injuries will prohibit the use of two-handed weapons. 

**Bonus:** Indicates any bonus base dice you get when using the weapon. This bonus can be reduced by damage or by pushing rolls (page 9). If the bonus is reduced to zero, the weapon breaks and needs to be repaired using the Crafting skill. 

**Damage:** Indicates your base damage rating, i.e. how many points of damage your opponent suffers if your attack is successful. If you roll extra successes, you deal additional damage. 

**Range:** Indicates the maximum range category at which the weapon can be used. 

**Weight:** Indicates how many regular items the weapon counts as in the inventory list.

Here is the information formatted as a Markdown table:

### Weapons
| Weapon          | Grip            | Bonus | Damage | Range   | Weight  |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| Unarmed         | —               | —     | 1      | Engaged       | - |
| Blunt instrument| 1H              | +1    | 1      | Engaged | 1       |
| Knife           | 1H              | +1    | 2      | Engaged | ½       |
| Club            | 1H              | +2    | 1      | Engaged | 1       |
| Sword           | 1H              | +2    | 2      | Engaged | 1       |
| Battleaxe       | 2H              | +2    | 3      | Engaged | 2       |
| Spear           | 1H              | +1    | 2      | Short   | 1       |
| Rock            | 1H              | —     | 1      | Medium  | ¼       |
| Sling           | 1H              | +1    | 1      | Medium  | ½       |
| Bow             | 2H              | +1    | 1      | Long    | 1       |
| Pistol          | 1H              | +2    | 2      | Medium  | ½       |
| Rifle           | 2H              | +2    | 2      | Long    | 1       |

## Damage & Stress

Damage and stress to characters is managed differently in different versions of the YZE. It can reduce your Health and Resolve scores, directly reduce your attributes, or give you conditions (page 21). 

### Suffering Damage & Stress 
You can suffer damage in many ways. These are the most common: 

✦ **Pushing:** How pushing rolls can inflict damage and stress is described on page 9. Armor has no effect against damage from pushing. 
✦ **Attacks:** Whenever you attack someone in combat, you inflict damage equal to the base damage rating of the weapon, plus one additional point of damage for each extra success rolled beyond the first. The same goes for damage from explosions, fire, etc. 
✦ **Stressful Situations:** When your PC is subjected to fear or a stressful situation, the GM determines the potential stress inflicted (see the table on page 20). You then make an In- sight roll (not an action) – each success rolled eliminates one point of potential stress. You can push the roll, but at the risk of suffering even more stress if you get any on the re-roll.

>[!information] Attribute Damage 
>In some YZE games, damage is inflicted directly on your core attributes. When pushing a roll, you suffer damage to the attribute rolled for. Only base dice from the attribute count, not from skills. Physical attacks typically reduce your Strength, but some phenomena can target the other attributes as well. In a game using attribute damage, “damage” means damage to Strength unless otherwise specified. Games with attribute damage don’t use the term “stress” – instead, stressful situations inflict damage to your Wits.

### Stressful Situations
| Factor                                | Stress |
|---------------------------------------|--------|
| Being threatened with violence        | 1      |
| Seeing a friendly character suffer a lethal critical injury | 1      |
| Seeing something unnatural            | 1      |
| Seeing a friendly character die       | 2      |
| Being interrogated                    | 2      |
| Facing a frightening supernatural being | 2      |
| Witnessing a massacre                 | 3      |
| Being tortured                        | 3      |
| Witnessing a horrible supernatural event | 3      |
### Cover 
When enemies are shooting at you, hunkering down behind cover – preferably something solid – can save your life. Taking cover in the zone you’re in counts as a fast action. Cover has an armor rating and works exactly like armor – but only against ranged attacks. Cover can be degraded just like armor. Cover can be combined with armor – roll for cover first, then armor.

| Barrier | Armor Rating |
| ---- | ---- |
| Furniture | D |
| Wooden Door | C |
| Tree Trunk | C |
| Wooden Wall | B |
| Stone Wall | A |

## Conditions 

Some YZE games manage damage and trauma via conditions. Typically, these are divided into the three physical conditions and three mental conditions: 
✦ **Physical Conditions:** Exhausted, Battered, Wounded 
✦ **Mental Conditions:** Angry, Scared, Disheartened 

### Getting Conditions 
You can get conditions by pushing a dice roll (page 9). When pushing a roll for Strength or Agility, you get a physical condition of your choice. When pushing a roll for Wits or Empathy, you get a mental condition of your choice. 

**Damage & Stress:** Damage from external attacks gives you one physical condition of your choice for each point of damage. Stressful situations give you a number of mental conditions equal to the amount of potential stress (page 20), reduced by one for each success on an Insight roll. 

### Effects of Conditions 
Each physical condition you have gives you a −1 modifier to skills rolls using Strength or Agility, while each mental condition gives you −1 to rolls for Wits or Empathy. When you already have three conditions of the same type and acquire a fourth one, you become broken and sustain a critical injury of the relevant type (page 21). 

## BROKEN

In most YZE games, your PC can be broken by damage or stress. Being broken basically means you are taken out of action, and you might risk even lethal injuries. When broken, you can’t perform any actions or roll for any skills.

### Getting Broken 
How you get broken depends on the specific damage system used: 
**✦ Health & Resolve:** In a system using Health and Re- solve (page 5), you are broken if either of these scores are reduced to zero by damage or stress. 
**✦ Attribute Damage:** In a system using attribute damage, you are broken if any attribute is reduced to zero. 
**✦ Conditions:** In a system using conditions (page 21), you are broken when you have suffered a set number of physical or mental conditions. 

### More Damage 
You can’t go below zero in Health, Resolve, or any attribute. If you suffer further damage, you may suffer an additional critical injury however. 

### Recovery 
Being broken is not fatal in itself – only critical injuries (page 21) can actually kill you. There are two ways to recover after being broken, assuming you’re not dead. 

**Getting Help:** Someone can help you recover by using the Healing skill. This is a slow action. If the roll is successful, you immediately heal damage or stress equal to the number of successes rolled. The Healing roll only has this effect on a broken victim. 

**On Your Own:** If no one is around to help you, you auto- matically heal one point of damage or stress after one Shift has passed. 

**Not Broken?** If you are not broken, you heal one point of damage or stress per shift. This assumes that you are not starving, dehydrated, or hypothermic (page 25). You can heal damage and stress at the same time.

> [!important] Broken NPCs
NPCs can be broken in the same ways as PCs. An NPC can use Healing on a PC and vice versa. However, dice are usually not rolled when an NPC heals another NPC – instead, the GM decides what happens. The GM can also decide that a minor NPC who is broken by damage simply dies. 

## Critical Injuries 

Critical injuries are dangerous, even lethal, injuries to your body or mind. The way you suffer critical injuries varies be- tween YZE games. Here are some examples: 

✦ You suffer a physical critical injury when your Health is reduced to zero, and a mental critical injury when your Resolve is reduced to zero
✦ You suffer a physical critical injury when your Strength is reduced to zero, and a mental critical injury when your Wits is reduced to zero. 
✦ You suffer a physical critical injury when you are broken by physical conditions, and a mental critical injury when you are broken by mental conditions. 
✦ You suffer a physical critical injury when an attack against you inflicts damage equal to or in excess of the Crit thresh- old of the weapon. 
✦ You suffer a physical critical injury when an attack against you rolls two or more successes.

>There is one case where you don’t risk any critical injury when broken: when you push a roll so hard that you break yourself. This is very rare, but it can happen. This means you can never kill yourself by pushing a roll


### Rolling for the Crit 
When you suffer a critical injury, roll on a table to see what it is. Sample tables for physical and mental critical injuries can be found on page 22 and 23. In some YZE games, the weapon used determines which dice to roll to determine the critical injury. 

### Death 
Physical critical injuries can be lethal. If you suffer such an in- jury, you must make a death save when the listed time limit has passed – one round, stretch, or shift. If the time limit is round, make the roll on your next turn. The death save is not an action in itself. A death save is a roll for Stamina. If a death save fails, you die. If you succeed, you linger on, but you must make another death save when the listed amount of time has passed again. 

**Stabilizing Crits**: To stabilize a lethal critical injury and save your life, one or more Healing rolls must be made. Medi- cal gear can give positive modifiers to the roll.
The Healing roll takes the same amount of time to perform as the time limit of your critical injury. If the roll succeeds, the time limit of your crit is increased by one category (e.g., from round to stretch). When a crit with a time limit of a shift is successfully treated, you no longer risk dying and you don’t need to make any further death saves. If the Healing roll fails, trying again is allowed – but only after another death save has been made. 

**Broken:** If you are both broken and have sustained a lethal critical injury, two separate Healing rolls are needed: one to get you back on your feet, and another one to save your life. These two rolls can be made in whichever order you prefer. 

**Instant Kill:** Note that some critical injuries will kill you outright. If you gain any of these, your character dies immediately. No death save is allowed.

### HEALING CRITS 
Each critical injury has a specific effect that you suffer during the healing time indicated, which is measured in days. If you have several crits, they will heal simultaneously. If an injury is listed as permanent, it will never heal. 

**Skill Modifiers:** Skill roll modifiers due to critical injuries are cumulative, and apply even if you don’t have the skill. 

**Care:** If someone tends to you for a shift per day during the process of healing a critical injury and makes a Healing roll, that day counts double. 

**Damage:** Note that you can heal all of your damage, but still suffer the effects of a critical injury. 

>[!info] Other Types of Damage 
>For some special types of physical damage – for example from fire, cold, starvation, etc. – the critical damage table is not used. Instead, the effects of being broken by these forms of damage are described in the relevant rules section below

## Other Hazards 

### Darkness 
In complete darkness, you have no choice but to feel your way around. To run in complete darkness requires a successful Mobility roll, and you take one point of damage if you fail. You can attack opponents at Engaged range normally in darkness, but with a −2 modifier. At Short range, you must roll for Observation successfully (no action) to be able to attack the target, also with a −2 modifier. You cannot hit targets at Medium range or more in total darkness. 

### Fire 
When exposed to fire, roll for its intensity. In the dice pool sys- tem, fires typically range from 3 to 9. In the step dice system, fire intensities range from D to A, and you roll two base dice of the corresponding type. 

**Effect:** For every success rolled for the fire, you suffer one point of damage. If you take damage, you catch fire and con- tinue to burn. When burning, you suffer another attack each round, on your turn. The intensity increases by one step each round. As soon as a fire attack inflicts no damage, the fire goes out by itself. You, or a friend at Engaged range, can put out the fire with a successful Mobility roll (slow action). Using a blanket or similar object gives a +2 modifier. 

**Crits:** Fire doesn’t cause normal critical injuries. Instead, if you are broken by fire damage, or suffer fire damage when al- ready broken, you must make a death save on your turn every round until you die or you are saved by a Healing roll. 

### Explosions 
The force of an explosion is measured by its blast power. For each person within Short range of the blast (i.e., in the same zone), roll for the blast power. See the table on page 24, which also indicates the base damage rating of the explosion. The roll cannot be pushed. 

**Effect:** If one or more successes are rolled, the target is hit by the blast and suffers the base damage. The damage done is increased by one for each additional success rolled beyond the first. Victims at Engaged range from the detonation suffer one extra point of damage (a minimum of one point). 

**Effect Radius:** Powerful charges can harm victims even at Medium range (i.e., adjacent zones) if nothing blocks the blast. The blast power is then reduced by 6 (dice pool system) or two steps (step dice system)

#### Blast Power
| DICE POOL STEP | DICE | BASE DAMAGE |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| 12             | A    | 4           |
| 9              | B    | 3           |
| 6              | C    | 2           |
| 3              | D    | 1           |
### Falling 
Falling on a hard surface automatically inflicts an amount of damage to you equal to the height of the fall (in meters) divided by 2, rounding all fractions down. In a controlled jump, roll Mobility – each success rolled reduces the damage done by one.

### Drowning 
All PCs are assumed to know how to swim. If you end up in water, you need to make a Stamina roll every stretch to stay afloat. If you wear metal armor, you sink. Under water, you need to make a Stamina roll every round to hold your breath. If you fail, you start to drown and suffer one point of damage to Strength every round until someone saves you. If you are broken when drowning, you die after one stretch. 

### Poison 
Poisons are measured by its toxicity. A weak poison has toxicity 3 (D in the step dice system), a strong poison has toxicity 6 (C), and an extremely potent poison can have toxicity 9 (B) or even more. If you ingest poison, make an opposed roll for Stamina against the toxicity (two base dice of the corresponding type in the step dice system). If you fail the roll, you suffer its effect below. Antidotes can halt the effect of a poison. 

**Lethal Poison:** You take one point of damage on your turn each round until you are broken, at which point you roll again to resist the poison. If you fail, you die. 

**Paralyzing Poison:** You cannot move or perform any actions for one stretch. 

**Sleeping Poison:** You fall asleep, unable to wake up for a shift. 

### Disease 
When exposed to a dangerous contagion or infection, make an opposed roll for Stamina against the virulence rating of the disease. This is called an infection roll. A typical disease has a virulence of 6 (C in the step dice system, roll two base dice of the corresponding type), but there are diseases with much higher virulence. If you fail the roll, you fall ill, which means you suffer one point of damage and cannot heal damage. Make another infection roll once per day. Each failed roll means you suffer another point of damage. If you are broken by damage while sick, you die after another day if you’re not given aid (below) before then. As soon as you succeed at an infection roll, you are no longer ill. Stop rolling infection rolls and heal your damage normally. 

**Healing:** If you are cared for by someone during your sick- ness, this person can roll your sickness rolls instead of you. The healer rolls for their Healing skill with a +2 modifier. 

### Cold 
When the cold is bitter and you don’t have adequate clothes or shelter (GM’s discretion), you must roll for Stamina at regular intervals. The colder it is, the more frequently you need to roll. A chilly fall day requires a roll per day – in winter, you might have to roll once every shift or even every stretch in extreme conditions. Extra protection, like a blanket, can give a bonus to your roll. If you fail, you become hypothermic and suffer one point of damage and one point of stress (damage to Strength and Wits). You also cannot heal naturally. You must keep rolling for Stamina at the same interval, suffering more damage and stress each time you fail. If you are broken while hypothermic, you die the next time you need to roll. Only after you have warmed up, if only by a campfire, are you able to heal again. 

### Starvation 
You must eat a ration of food at least once every day. After a day without food, you starve. When starving, you don’t heal damage (Strength) normally. You heal stress (other attributes) normally. You also suffer one point of damage per week. If you are broken while Starving, you die after another week without food. As soon as you have eaten, you are no longer starving. 

### Sleep Deprivation 
You need to sleep for at least one shift each day. After one day without sleep, you cannot heal stress (damage to Wits). If you are broken by stress (damage to Wits) while sleep deprived, you collapse and sleep for at least one shift, and are unable to wake up during that time. As soon as you have slept for at least a shift, you are no longer sleep deprived. 

## Mounts 

A horse or other riding animal can be a useful asset. The animal can carry gear for you, and you can take advantage of being in the saddle during combat. 

**Movement:** Mounts allow you to move faster in combat than on foot. When making a move action, make a Mobility roll – for each success, you may move an additional zone. Mounts generally can’t move into Cramped zones at all. In Cluttered zones, they can only move one zone per action. 

**Move:** When you are on horseback and make a Mobility roll, use the animal’s Agility instead of your own. 

**Close Combat:** You can fight from horseback, but only with one-handed weapons. Opponents attacking you must decide if they attack you or the horse. Attacks against a mounted rider suffer a −1 penalty. 

**Ranged Combat:** All ranged attacks from horseback suffer a −2 modification. Opponents shooting at you must decide if they attack you or the horse. 

**Damage:** Your mount can suffer damage, just like you, through attacks or by pushing rolls when you are using the animal’s attribute score. Animals recover damage just like PCs. An animal that has its Strength reduced to zero does not suffer a critical injury, instead it is considered perished. Animals generally don’t have Wits or Empathy.

# Magic

What most people call magic is a catch-all term for forces at work behind the veil of the world, beyond what the common folk understand or dare perceive. Magic is a wild and unreliable force that can manifest itself in many ways. There are no schools of magic, instead knowledge is transferred from master to apprentice in a number of broad categories, called disciplines. There are seven disciplines in this SRD. Three of these are for druidic magic – Awareness, Healing, and Shapeshifting – while four are for sorcery: Blood Magic, Death Magic, Elementalism, and Sym- bolism. Every discipline is linked to a tiered specialty (page 13), that is a prerequisite to be able to cast spells within each discipline. 

### Learning Magic 
To learn a new discipline, or increase your rank in a discipline you already know, you should find a master with a higher rank than you in the magic specialty and who is ready to share their secrets with you. This can require both persuasion and substantial compensation. Without a teacher, the cost in XP for increasing the rank in a magical specialty or learning a new one is tripled. 

## Spells 

Your attempts to use magic to impose your will on the world are called spells. A large number of spells are described later in this chapter. 

### Spell Ranks 
All spells in this chapter are rated in ranks ranging from 1 to 3. There can be spells of even higher rank. As a magic user, you can cast all spells that are at a rank equal to or lower than your rank in the related magical talent. 

**Chance Casting:** If you really want to, you can cast a spell at one rank above the rank of your magical talent. However, this comes at a great risk, as you will automatically suffer a random magic mishap in this case. You can never cast a spell that is two ranks or more above your talent rank. 

### Casting a Spell 
Casting a spell is generally a slow action in combat, but there are also so-called power words that are fast actions. Another type of spell are rituals that take a longer time to cast (see the sidebar on page 31). Whether or not a spell is a power word or ritual is detailed under each spell. Casting a spell requires a great deal of mental exertion and requires that you spend one or more Willpower Points (WP). You typically accumulate WP by pushing dice rolls (page 9), but some YZE games can introduce other ways to gain WP. The more WP you spend, the more powerful the effect of the spell is. 

**Power Level:** The number of Willpower Points you spend when you cast a spell is called its base power level. Dice rolls and other factors can further modify the power level. 

**Rolling Dice:** Unlike skills, you can never fail at casting a spell. Instead, you roll a number of base dice (D6s) equal to the number of Willpower Points you spend. If you roll one or several successes (sixes), the spell is overcharged, and if you roll one or several banes (ones) you suffer some sort of magic mishap. You cannot push this roll.

**Overcharging:** When you cast a spell, every success you roll increases its power level by one. For example, if you spend 2 WP to cast a spell and roll two successes, its power level is increased to 4. MAGIC MISHAP: If you roll one or several banes when you cast a spell, you have unleashed powerful forces but are unable to control them and you suffer a magic mishap. Roll D66 on the table on the next page. 

**Safe Casting:** If you cast a spell at a lower rank than your talent rank for the discipline, you may opt to roll one less die for every point of difference. This reduces the risk of a magic mishap, but also makes the spell less likely to overcharge. If the result is zero dice or less, don’t roll at all – the spell simply works as intended. 

**Range:** Every spell has a range, which denotes the maximum distance at which it can be cast. The range Personal means the spell only affects yourself. 

**Duration:** Every spell has a duration. Immediate means that the effect is instantaneous and does not last. 

**Willpower Points:** Casting a spell requires at least one Willpower Point. This applies even if it does not explicitly say so in the description of the spell
