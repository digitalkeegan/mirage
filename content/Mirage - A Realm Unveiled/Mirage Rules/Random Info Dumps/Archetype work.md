## Groups

Free Traders
Mercenaries
Explorers
Agents
Pilgrims


Before creating your PCs, you should decide together what kind of group your PCs make up. Your group can consist of all kinds of individuals – the group concept only outlines your most basic reason for sticking together in the Al-Sarab. The group concept will also tell you what type of caravan you will begin play with (if any), what group talent you will have, and who your patron and nemesis will be. There are five group concepts to choose from: Agents, Mercenaries, Free Traders, Pilgrims and Explorers.

### Free Traders 

Commerce is what greases the wheels of the Third Horizon, and the hub of trade in the region is the space station Coriolis. The free traders are the entrepreneurs and innovators of the Horizon, embracers of the new order – with a few exceptions. Tariffs, tolls, and bureaucrats looking to make a quick buck abusing the trade system are all things despised by any free trader. As Free Traders, you will portal jump between the different systems of the Third Horizon, hauling everything from goats on ice or farm machinery to candied Kabra bugs and illegal Vulcan carbines. In small freighters or enormous bulk haulers, you travel silent routes in an ocean of cold starlight. Slipping past corrupt toll collectors, blockade ships and corsairs is all part of your thrilling lives. 

The Free Traders group concept can also be used for: 
◆ Smugglers carrying illegal cargo to the highest bidder. 
◆ Bulk haulers on lonely routes with heavy loads.
◆ Couriers delivering valuable information. 

Possible character concepts (with sub-concepts) for PCs as a group of Free Traders: 

◆ negotiator (peddler). If it wasn’t for you, the crew would still be delivering livestock to the asteroid belt. You make sure those sweet birr end up in your bank account.
◆ pilot (freighter pilot). Someone needs to fly this thing. 
◆ scientist (technician). A ship is only as good as its mechanic or technician. You make sure the group gets anywhere at all. 
◆ ship worker (deckhand). There is always something that needs doing onboard. The others may think that you mainly scrub air filters, but there is no one who knows the ship like you do. ◆ ship worker (dock worker). You oversee the cargo – a crap job some would say, but this is far from true. Without you, the crew wouldn’t earn a single birr. 
◆ soldier (legionnaire). Corsairs, mercenaries, smugglers. The list of cold-blooded fighters out there in the Dark is long. You and your Vulcan carbine protect the group when the going gets rough.

### Mercenaries 
Not all can enjoy the peace and prosperity of the new era. Old wounds fester in the dark, and the absence of peace means plenty of job opportunities for people like you: Mercenaries. As such, you are often both feared and scorned, yet valuable pawns in the power plays of the factions. Mercenaries can be anything from Legionnaires to hired guns for the Consortium. Typical jobs for you would be crushing rebels on Uharu-9, hunting corsairs in the Border Space, or toppling Dabaran pashas. 

The Mercenaries group concept can also be used for: 
◆ Corsairs plundering careless free traders on lonely routes. 
◆ Rebels fighting to free their people from oppression. 
◆ Tactical teams performing whatever military operations the factions might require. 

Possible concepts (with sub-concepts) for PCs as a group of Mercenaries: 
◆ soldier (officer). Without you, the group would be without discipline. In a crisis, you are quick to take charge. 
◆ soldier (legionnaire). The backbone of any mercenary group. You could be anything from a field medicurg, to a weapons expert or a marine. Regardless, you and your trusty carbine get the job done. 
◆ trailblazer (scout). You make sure your surroundings are clear, be it in the hills of the Xifas ridge or the scrap belt around Qugassa. You could be a sniper, a scout, an ex-burglar or a sensor specialist. 
◆ pilot (fighter pilot). Someone has to fly the iron fist you call your ship, or land your drop pod or armored hovercraft. 
◆ scientist (technician). Tending to your death machines is a rigorous job. Without someone to look after the crew’s equip- ment, you’d soon be worth about as much as skavara droppings in a dung plant. 
◆ operative (spy). You are the group’s expert on alarm systems and infiltration, and your network of contacts is vast. With your help, the jobs run smoother and require less Vulcan hails than they otherwise would.


### Explorers 
The Horizon is full of mysteries to uncover. You are truth seekers who refuse to settle for the Bulletin’s oversimplified version of reality. It’s all there, if you just scratch the surface a little. Explorers not only delve into the past, they also push beyond the frontiers of the Horizon – as colonists, curious anthropologists or traveling journalists. As Explorers, you dig through the frozen ruins on Surha, the remnants of the Portal Builders in the jungles of Kua, or search for forgotten colonies along the Enau Arm. 

The Explorers group concept can also be used for:
◆ Prospectors seeking valuable minerals in dangerous asteroid belts. 
◆ Colonists valiantly claiming new settlements for the peoples of the Horizon. 
◆ Correspondents reporting the news no one else dares to. 

Possible concepts (with sub-concepts) for PCs as a group of Explorers: 
◆ scientist (archaeologist). Whether it’s digging for ruins in the desert or mapping the mysterious gravitation pools, you are an explorer in the truest sense. 
◆ trailblazer (prospector). You know how to find all the Horizon’s riches, from ice ore or Helium-3 to shipwrecks or the finest timber. 
◆ scientist (technician). Whether it’s calibrating the macroscope and the deep space sensors, or repairing the colony’s old grav tractor, you are essential to the group. 
◆ pilot (freighter pilot). The crew would get nowhere without you, especially if the destination is somewhere no one’s been in a while. 
◆ trailblazer (scout). As a colonist or pathfinder, you are vital to discovering both valuables and threats during your travels. 
◆ data spider (correspondent). You are the number one news hunter. No truths slip by your keen eyes and ears. 

### Agents 
Birr and Legionnaires are not always the best tools for a faction – sometimes, more subtle means are required. This is where the Agent cells come in. Typical jobs for a group of Agents might be infiltrating Dabaran courts, assassinating dignitaries, tracking down lost relatives, or just keeping the scum on Coriolis in check.

The Agents group concept can also be used for: 
◆ Judicators keeping the Coriolis station free from criminals. 
◆ Assassins making sure that troublemakers disappear. 
◆ Detectives for hire. 

Possible concepts (with sub-concepts) for PCs as a group of Agents: 
◆ operative (spy). You are the core of the cell with your skill set of infiltration, subtle cons, and surveillance. 
◆ trailblazer (scout). If anyone can follow a trail – in a crowded bazaar or on the vast savannah – it’s you. 
◆ soldier (officer). All groups need organization and contacts, things you possess as well as practical knowledge of combat and social interaction. 
◆ artist (courtesan). You are the true manipulator. Your skill and reputation gets you in anywhere, and what you need doing done. 
◆ data spider (correspondent). You dig through old archives, Bulletin logs and info terminals. No stored information is out of your reach. 

### Pilgrims 
The Pilgrimage is an important rite for everyone in the Horizon, and for some it is their calling. Other pilgrims travel for different reasons than to visit the holy sites: look- ing for work, searching for wisdom, or spreading joy to the Horizon as traveling circuses. Lastly, there are the nomads of the Horizon. They usually remain in one system or one sector, but sometimes they also travel through the dangerous portal fields. Regardless of why you travel, your lives will be hard and painful. Getting to visit the Dome of the Icons on Coriolis, the Leaning Prayer Tower on Algol, Mira’s Icon City, or the temple city of Lotus on Dabaran is achieved only by the truly dedicated – as is experiencing the joy of the audience as Kassar the Nimble performs his triple salto mortale. 

The Pilgrims group concept can also be used for: 
◆ “Hands” – traveling workers taking jobs where they are to be found. 
◆ Traveling circuses made up of entertainers and performers. 
◆ Space nomads, perpetually trudging the starry void. 

Possible concepts (with sub-concepts) for PCs as a group of Pilgrims: 
◆ preacher (missionary). You preach, see visions, and strive to make the peoples of the Horizon understand the greatness of the Icons. 
◆ negotiator (diplomat). You are the one who makes sure that your crew always gets to your destinations – acquiring new passports and papers with the correct stamps, as well as paying the occasional bribe. 
◆ ship worker (deckhand). You can work just about anywhere, be it on a ship or in a bar – someone with a broad skill set is always needed, and that someone is you. 
◆ artist (courtesan). As a master of the arts of pleasure, you can perform anything from a chai ceremony to intricate dances and the sacred Algolan incense prayers. 
◆ negotiator (peddler). You are a traveling merchant, supplying whatever people are demanding. 

### Caravan (Spaceship)

Your PCs will begin play with a spaceship. Decide together as a group which spaceship to pick using the rules and tables in Chapter 7. Your most logical choice would be a ship suited to your group concept, but nothing prevents you from picking one with entirely different qualities. You could also choose to design your ship from scratch using the ship construction rules in Chapter 7. Regardless of your choice, you will begin your adventures in debt. 

### Debt 
As you begin playing, you will not yet entirely own your spacecraft. Depending on the ship type you choose, a sizeable debt will lie between you and calling the ship your very own. As you begin playing, your collective debt will be 50% of the ship's original value. Who you owe the money to is up to you to decide – it could be to your patron, some other NPC, or maybe your nemesis! Whomever you owe the money to will expect regular payments from you – estimate 5% of the total debt per year in monthly payments. In other words, already from the start you will have a very good reason to make sure you make enough birr to keep your ship flying. If you play your cards right you might even find yourselves the rightful owners of your very own spaceship, but it’s a long road getting there. 

### Group Talents
When creating your group, pick one of the talents connected to your group concept. Everyone in the group can use this talent. Talents are described in Chapter 4.


### Patron and Nemesis 

The Third Horizon is a hard place, and getting anywhere without help is difficult. It has become something of tradition for smaller ship crews to ally themselves with a powerful benefactor. As a group, pick a patron from your group concept list below. If you’d rather come up with a patron of your own, you may, as long as the GM agrees. You will also begin play with an enemy, a nemesis who can suddenly turn up to spoil your plans, or stay in the shadows as a lurking threat. Just like the patron, the nemesis is described briefly below. Pick a nemesis from the list or come up with one of your own. 

#### The Free Traders’ Patron/Nemesis 
◆ Aldair Jubal (Jubal Imports & Exports). A shady peddler from Djachroum, making sure the flow of spices, drugs and weapons continues.

◆ Jihvane Kourides (Special Branch of the Consortium). A field agent rising through the ranks who will stop at nothing to climb even higher. 
◆ Hiram “the Black Widow” Momasdi (Ahlam’s Black Lotuses). An aged madam who is secretly an assassin, offering her customers anything but pleasure.
