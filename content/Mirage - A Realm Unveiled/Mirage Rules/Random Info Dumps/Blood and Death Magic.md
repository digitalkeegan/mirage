## Blood Magic
*Blood magic derives its power from life itself and its liquid essence – blood.*

### Firewalker

- Rank 1 
- Range: Personal 
- Duration: Shift 

You can make yourself completely immune to heat and cold (page 25). You take no damage from fire.

### Stir Blood

- Rank 1 
- Range: Short 
- Duration: Stretch 

Using this spell, you stir your victim’s blood and bring out strong emotions such as lust, fear, or rage. The victim must give in to these emotions in some way – exactly how depends on the individual and the situation. The GM determines the details. The spell has no effect in combat and cannot be used against monsters.

### Bind Demon

- Rank 2 
- Range: Short 
- Duration: Shift 

This spell allows you to bend demonic creatures from other worlds to your will. The demon can resist the spell with a successful Insight roll with a negative modifier equal to the power level. Keep in mind that demons rarely react well to magicians’ attempts to Bind them, so be ready for any consequences.

### Blood Bond

- Rank 2 
- Range: Engaged 
- Duration: Immediate 

You can transfer blood, and the inherent energy of it, to or from another being of the same kind as yourself. You can transfer a number of Health or Resolve points (or attribute points, if using the dice pool system) equal to the power level to or from the target. The starting score cannot be surpassed. Points lost in this way can be recovered normally. An unwilling victim can make an Insight roll, with a negative modifier equal to the power level, to resist the spell. The spell can be used to get a broken person up on their feet, but it has no effect on critical injuries.

### Immolate

- Rank 2 
- Range: Short 
- Duration: Immediate 

You can heat up your victim’s blood to the point where they literally burst into flames. The spell inflicts damage equal to the power level and then sets the target on fire with an intensity (page 24) equal to twice the power level. If using the step dice system, the intensity is D for power level 1, C for power level 2, B for 3, and A for power level 4 or above. Armor does not protect against this spell.

### Blood Channeling

- Rank 3 
- Range: Personal 
- Duration: Round 

This spell concentrates the energy of the sorcerer’s own blood. You gain a number of Willpower Points equal to twice the power level. The effect is temporary, however. Your newly won Willpower Points must be used in the next round, or they are lost. If you use a living sacrifice as an ingredient for your spell, it must be sacrificed before you cast the spell. A small animal is enough.

### Blood Curse

- Rank 3, Ritual 
- Range: Unlimited 
- Duration: One shift per power level 

You place a blood curse on your victim, who must be a living humanoid. You must know your victim’s name and know where they are, at least approximately. The victim suffers damage or stress (any attribute, if using attribute damage). The amount of damage equals the power level, and the victim takes one point of damage per shift until the full effect is reached. During this time, no natural healing is possible.

### Bind Soul

- Rank 3, Ritual 
- Range: Engaged 
- Duration: Varies 

Through this ritual, you can extract a victim’s soul from his blood and capture it in a vessel of some kind (such as a mirror, a jewel, or a weapon). Your victim must make an Insight roll with a negative modification equal to the power level. If the roll fails, the victim is bound to the vessel for a shift. Making the effect last one full day requires power level 2 or higher, and if you want the victim to remain in the vessel forever – or up to a time of your choosing – it requires power level 3. You can specify a condition that must be filled to free the soul. The victim can be freed by a Dispel Magic (page 31). While the soul is bound, the body is unconscious and can be killed or possessed by another restless spirit.


## Death Magic
*Death magic draws its power from dead or dying beings, from rot and decay. Practitioners of death magic, known as necromancers, can also steal power from living things by twisting and tainting them, which is the reason for much of the hate and fear these black arts stir up. The necromancers see themselves as seekers of truth, as pioneers and explorers of the true nature of life and death*.

### Befoul

- Rank 1 
- Range: Short 
- Duration: Immediate 

You can let death and decay seep into food. You can Befoul a ration of food per power level making it unfit for consumption. The food turns into a poison with a toxicity equal to the lower level multiplied by 3 in the dice pool system. In the step dice system, power level 1 gives toxicity D, power level toxicity C, etc.

### Chill of the Grave

- Rank 1 
- Range: Engaged 
- Duration: One round per power level 

You let the unrelenting cold of death seep into your victim. The victim becomes cold (page 25), immediately suffering one point of damage and one point of stress (damage to Strength and Wits) as a result. The victim continues to suffer one point of damage and stress each round until the total amount of damage and stress each equal the power level. The spell has no effect on monsters.

### Contaminate

- Rank 1 
- Range: Engaged 
- Duration: Immediate 

You can create horrid contagions with which to torment your enemies. Your victim, who must be a living humanoid, contracts a disease with a virulence equal to the power level multiplied by 3 in the dice pool system. In the step dice system, power level 1 gives virulence D, power level virulence C, etc.

### Ghoulish Glare

- Rank 1 
- Range: Medium 
- Duration: Immediate 

Your murky appearance instills unease and fear in your victim. They suffer stress (damage to Empathy if using attribute damage) equal to the power level. This spell can only be used against living humanoids.

### Hand of Doom

- Rank 2 
- Range: Short 
- Duration: Immediate 

You can claw your way to your victim’s heart magically and squeeze the life from them. This spell inflicts damage equal to the power level. You can extend the range to Medium if you spend an extra Willpower Point (this does not count towards the power level). This spell can only be used against living humanoids.

### Raise the Dead

- Rank 2, Ritual 
- Range: Short 
- Duration: Shift 

The main task of Death Magic is awakening the dead. In its simplest form, this ritual is used to reanimate one dead humanoid or animal, which will become a rank 1 undead. For each power level beyond the first, you can reanimate one more undead or increase the rank of all undead raised by the spell by one. A ritual with power level 2 can raise two undead of rank 1, power level 3 can raise two undead of rank 2, and so on. A rank 1 undead has little to no mental capacity, but will obey simple commands and can use weapons and simple tools. The undead has the same Strength it did in life, Agility is decreased by one (no lower than 1), and it has no Wits or Empathy. Skills based on Strength and Agility are retained. A rank 2 undead can be enhanced in one of the following ways:
- **Stronger:** The Strength score increases by 1. This effect can be chosen several times for undead of higher ranks.
- **Smarter:** The undead regains some of its lost mental capacity, in the form of both Wits and Empathy and skills associated with these attributes. All the scores are lowered by one (no lower than 1). The undead can answer questions about its life both before and after death, but it often has an unclear sense of time and can be very forgetful. It obeys its maker and can perform slightly more advanced tasks.
- **Durable:** The duration of the spell is doubled. This effect can be chosen several times for undead of higher levels. A rank 3 undead gets two of the effects above. A rank 4 undead gets three effects, a rank 5 gets four effects, and so on.

### Speak to the Dead

- Rank 2 
- Range: Short 
- Duration: Stretch 

You can speak with the dead. You must be within Short range of where the victim died or lies buried. You must know the victim’s name. You can speak with the dead for a few minutes and ask a few simple questions. The GM decides what the dead can and will answer – the dead aren’t always cooperative. If the victim’s remains are reasonably intact you can speak directly with the corpse, otherwise, you hear the dead as a disembodied hoarse voice in your head. This spell cannot be used against undead.

### Steal Life

- Rank 3, Ritual 
- Range: Short 
- Duration: Immediate 

You can suck the life from living plants and animals around you. You gain a number of Willpower Points equal to twice the power level. The ritual can only be used in an environment where there is vegetation and so cannot be used indoors or on a rocky mountain side. When you perform the ritual, all people, animals, and plants within Short range – in the same zone as you – die.

### Terror

- Rank 3 
- Range: Medium 
- Duration: Immediate 

You can instill a horrible, unbearable fear in your victim, whose mind is flooded by images of their own aging and death. The victim suffers stress (damage to both Wits and Empathy) equal to the power level. This spell only works on living humanoids.
