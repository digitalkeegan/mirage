>[!info] Other Types of Damage 
>For some special types of physical damage – for example from fire, cold, starvation, etc. – the critical damage table is not used. Instead, the effects of being broken by these forms of damage are described in the relevant rules section below

## Other Hazards 

### Darkness 
In complete darkness, you have no choice but to feel your way around. To run in complete darkness requires a successful Grace roll, and you take one point of damage if you fail. You can attack opponents at Engaged range normally in darkness, but with a −2 modifier. At Short range, you must roll for Observation successfully (no action) to be able to attack the target, also with a −2 modifier. You cannot hit targets at Medium range or more in total darkness. 

### Fire 

Catching fire causes you to take damage and suffer a Physical Condition. If the fire is not extinguished, you will keep taking damage at the start of each subsequent round. The amount of damage depends on the extent of the fire (see below), but also on an automatic Might roll you make to reduce the damage – each success deducts 1 point of damage (this is not an action). The only actions you can perform while burning are attempts to extinguish the fire, flee, or shout.

| Extent | Damage  | Successes to Extinguish |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Small part of the body is burning | 1 | 1 |
| Half the body is burning | 2 | 1 |
| Most of the body is burning | 3 | 2 |

**Crits:** Fire doesn’t cause normal critical injuries. Instead, if you are broken by fire damage, or suffer fire damage when already broken, you must make a death save on your turn every round until you die or you are saved by a Healing roll. 

### Explosions 
The force of an explosion is measured by its blast power. For each person within Short range of the blast (i.e., in the same zone), roll for the blast power. See the table on page 24, which also indicates the base damage rating of the explosion. The roll cannot be pushed. 

**Effect:** If one or more successes are rolled, the target is hit by the blast and suffers the base damage. The damage done is increased by one for each additional success rolled beyond the first. Victims at Engaged range from the detonation suffer one extra point of damage (a minimum of one point). 

**Effect Radius:** Powerful charges can harm victims even at Medium range (i.e., adjacent zones) if nothing blocks the blast. The blast power is then reduced by 6 (dice pool system) or two steps (step dice system)

#### Blast Power
| DICE POOL STEP | DICE | BASE DAMAGE |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| 12             | A    | 4           |
| 9              | B    | 3           |
| 6              | C    | 2           |
| 3              | D    | 1           |
### Falling 
Falling on a hard surface automatically inflicts an amount of damage to you equal to the height of the fall (in meters) divided by 2, rounding all fractions down. In a controlled jump, roll Grace – each success rolled reduces the damage done by one.

### Drowning 
All PCs are assumed to know how to swim. If you end up in water, you need to make a Stamina roll every stretch to stay afloat. If you wear metal armor, you sink. Under water, you need to make a Stamina roll every round to hold your breath. If you fail, you start to drown and suffer one point of damage to Strength every round until someone saves you. If you are broken when drowning, you die after one stretch. 

### Poison 
Poisons are measured by its toxicity. A weak poison has toxicity 3 (D in the step dice system), a strong poison has toxicity 6 (C), and an extremely potent poison can have toxicity 9 (B) or even more. If you ingest poison, make an opposed roll for Stamina against the toxicity (two base dice of the corresponding type in the step dice system). If you fail the roll, you suffer its effect below. Antidotes can halt the effect of a poison. 

**Lethal Poison:** You take one point of damage on your turn each round until you are broken, at which point you roll again to resist the poison. If you fail, you die. 

**Paralyzing Poison:** You cannot move or perform any actions for one stretch. 

**Sleeping Poison:** You fall asleep, unable to wake up for a shift. 

### Disease 
When exposed to a dangerous contagion or infection, make an opposed roll for Stamina against the virulence rating of the disease. This is called an infection roll. A typical disease has a virulence of 6 (C in the step dice system, roll two base dice of the corresponding type), but there are diseases with much higher virulence. If you fail the roll, you fall ill, which means you suffer one point of damage and cannot heal damage. Make another infection roll once per day. Each failed roll means you suffer another point of damage. If you are broken by damage while sick, you die after another day if you’re not given aid (below) before then. As soon as you succeed at an infection roll, you are no longer ill. Stop rolling infection rolls and heal your damage normally. 

**Healing:** If you are cared for by someone during your sick- ness, this person can roll your sickness rolls instead of you. The healer rolls for their Healing skill with a +2 modifier. 

### Cold 
When the cold is bitter and you don’t have adequate clothes or shelter (GM’s discretion), you must roll for Stamina at regular intervals. The colder it is, the more frequently you need to roll. A chilly fall day requires a roll per day – in winter, you might have to roll once every shift or even every stretch in extreme conditions. Extra protection, like a blanket, can give a bonus to your roll. If you fail, you become hypothermic and suffer one point of damage and one point of stress (damage to Strength and Wits). You also cannot heal naturally. You must keep rolling for Stamina at the same interval, suffering more damage and stress each time you fail. If you are broken while hypothermic, you die the next time you need to roll. Only after you have warmed up, if only by a campfire, are you able to heal again. 

### Starvation 
You must eat a ration of food at least once every day. After a day without food, you starve. When starving, you don’t heal damage (Strength) normally. You heal stress (other attributes) normally. You also suffer one point of damage per week. If you are broken while Starving, you die after another week without food. As soon as you have eaten, you are no longer starving. 

### Sleep Deprivation 
You need to sleep for at least one shift each day. After one day without sleep, you cannot heal stress (damage to Wits). If you are broken by stress (damage to Wits) while sleep deprived, you collapse and sleep for at least one shift, and are unable to wake up during that time. As soon as you have slept for at least a shift, you are no longer sleep deprived.
