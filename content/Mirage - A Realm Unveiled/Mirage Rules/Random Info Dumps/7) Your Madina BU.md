Your Madinah is home. This is where you have grown up, sheltered from the ever-changing environments of Al-Sarab. Ancient magic has kept the city in a physical stasis, even while the world shifts around you and the community has stayed strong, even venturing out in trade at times. But while the foundations of your city has been solid, the community itself is changing...

## Creating your Madinah

The Madinah, a settlement with usually a few hundred inhabitants, is the starting point of the game. All PCs live in the Madinah and have grown up there. Maybe you've never even left it before! The outside world, Al-Sarab is hard to understand and exceptionally dangerous. Creating your Madinah is the first thing you'll do together after creating your characters together. It’s a simple process – just follow the steps below. As with the rest of the game, there are no wrong answers here. It’s whatever all the players want the game to be.

> [!warning] Tone
> It would be best for you to confer with your fellow players, and the GM, with regards to setting to "tone" of the game prior to building out your Madinah.

## The Region
Before you create the Madinah itself, you need to determine what Region it is in. As a group, start by deciding where in Al-Sarab your Region, and thus your Madinah, is located. Answer the following questions:

- Our adventure takes place in... (The town is called [Name] and is situated in the [Region] of Al-Sarab)
- The general environment is...(Is it flat? Mountainous? A desert? Jungle?)
- The major rivers or coastlines are...

### The Region Map
The next step is to create a general map of the Region. This map is based on reports from traders or fading charts from long ago. The Region map has a hex grid. Every hex is called an Area, and is roughly one kilometre in diameter. The entire Region map should show, approximately, an area at least 30 kilometres wide.  If you don't have paper with an existing hex grid, six pieces of printer paper taped together will work well enough.

Unless your Madinah has multiple, significant, trade routes, most of the Region map will be blank at the start of the game – only coastlines, major rivers or lakes, prominent landmarks and places rumoured to hold great treasures or horrible dangers will be marked out. As play evolves, you will fill in the map with details, starting with filling in some Areas in the next part. Include a small compass to determine North. 

> [!info] Roads in your Region
> As you'll soon discover, the Region surrounding your Madinah is prone to constant shifts and transformations, reflecting the nature of Al-Sarab. Trade, therefore, becomes a challenging endeavor, crucial yet perilous. Ensure you incorporate a few roads connecting to and from your Madinah, but be aware that these paths may frequently navigate through hazardous terrains or vanish when Mirages materialize.

### Adding Areas
Take a set of polyhedral dice (and more dice if you’d like to add more features to your Region) and toss them onto the paper. Use the location the dice land and the face-up number to create locations in your Region based on the following chart:

| Roll | Location | Approximate Size |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Mirage Oasis | ![[Area_Medium.png\|100]] |
| 2 | Enchanted Forest or Deadly Jungle | ![[Area_Corridor.png\|150]] |
| 3 | Mirage Oasis | ![[Area_Medium.png\|100]] |
| 4 | Sun-Baked Canyon or Shadowy Ravine | ![[Area_Expanse.png\|100]] |
| 5 | Crystal Caverns or Subterranean Oasis | ![[Area_odd2.png\|80]] |
| 6 | Sand Dunes or Desert Vistas | ![[Area_Large.png\|100]] |
| 7 | Forgotten Metropolis or Ruined Citadel | ![[Area_Large.png\|100]] |
| 8 | Trading Hub or Caravansary | ![[Area_Single.png]] |
| 9 | Celestial Fountain or Astral Wellspring | ![[Area_Single.png]] |
| 10 | Mirage Oasis | ![[Area_Large.png\|100]] |
| 11 | Oasis Garden or Blossoming Glade | ![[Area_Single.png]] |
| 12 | Whispering Alpine Heights or Echoing Summit | ![[Area_Expanse.png\|100]] |
| 13 | Nomadic Camp or Tent Settlement | ![[Area_Single.png]] |
| 14 | Elemental Springs or Elemental Pools | ![[Area_Single.png]] |
| 15 | Fiery Abyss or Infernal Chasm | ![[Area_odd1.png\|100]] |
| 16 | Ethereal Pool or Lustrous Basin | ![[Area_Medium.png\|100]] |
| 17 | Blessed Waterfall or Ancient Observatory | ![[Area_Single.png]] |
| 18 | Entrance to Underground network or Buried city | ![[Area_EntranceExit.png\|120]] |
| 19 | Skyward Archipelago or Floating Isles | ![[Area_Separate.png\|150]] |
| 20 | Luminous Crystal Meadows or Radiant Glades | ![[Area_Medium.png\|100]] |
If you roll something that doesn’t make sense or roll too many of the same number, feel free to reroll. It should be noted, that the general shape is totally up to you, these sizes and shapes are simply a guide. 

Don’t get bogged down in making the map look beautiful, no matter how talented an artist you may be. Boxes, circles, outlined areas, or ten-second drawing of a location will work perfectly for the purposes of this map. Of course, if you want to make the map fancier, you can do that between sessions.

The Mirage Oases are special, keep them a simple circular shape as shown in the table, if possible. If you don't have at least two on the map, create more until you have a couple. It is recommended that you don't draw these onto your map permanently, and if you do draw them on, you do so lightly with a pencil - as these will move over time. A good idea is to cut out the shape of a Mirage Oases from a separate piece of paper, and stick them onto the map with something that can be removed easily, like washi tape.
## The Madinah
Once your Region map is done, it’s time to look closer at the Madinah itself. We want to encourage you to put in as much effort into this as is fun for you - but note that the more you do here, the better your adventures will be!
### Type of Madinah
The first thing you need to decide is what kind of city your Madinah is. Here are some examples, but feel free to choose for yourself:

- Desert Oasis
- Mountain Refuge
- Hidden Valley
- Waterfall Haven
- Ruined Citadel
- Subterranean Cavern
- Ancient Observatory
- Floating Island
- Underground Bunker
- Scrap Village
- Small Island

Discuss in the group and agree on something you all like.

### Madinah Details
Once you know what sort of Madinah you're playing in, players take turns answering the following questions to fill in the major details, adapting the number of questions asked as indicated below so that each player is answering the same number of questions about the town.

- Our adventure takes place in... (The town is called [Name] and is situated in the [Region] of Al-Sarab)
- An industry our town is best known for is…
- Our town is famous for…
- Our town is infamous for...
- Economically, our town is… (e.g., prospering, floundering, starting to stagnate) and one effect of that is...
- The town closest to us is named… and our relationship with that town is…(e.g., amicably competitive, resentful, economically envious, compassionately helpful). — Answer as a group with as much discussion as you need.
- A notable local organisation is… *Duplicate in a five-player game.*
- A notable local landmark is… *Duplicate in a three-player game or five-player game*.

### Madinah Position
Decide jointly in the group which Area to place the Madinah in. It's unlikely that the Madinah is found directly in the middle of the region, but placing it on very edge will make game-play difficult. It is recommended, if not totally necessary, to place the Madinah near the sea, a river or a large lake.

### Madinah Rumours
After constructing the town, each of you shares one rumour about the Madinah. Especially in small towns, rumours drive a lot of what goes on, but even in something the size of a small city there are still plenty of ways that news gets around. These can be mundane or supernatural, big or small, personal or about the entire town, generally believed or completely fringe… anything you want. The GM writes these rumours down, keeping them in mind so that they can influence the upcoming games, though there may be sources for the rumour that the players can’t even imagine. As long as you’re within the bounds of what the group has agreed to include in the game, there are no wrong answers. Also, not all rumours have to have any amount of truth to them...

Here are some examples:

- **Whispers of a Hidden Bazaar:** There are murmurs of a mystical bazaar that materializes only during the light of a crescent moon. Traders peddle rare artifacts and magical trinkets that can only be found within its mysterious confines.
- **The Enigmatic Alchemist's Elixir:** The local alchemist is said to have concocted a potion rumored to unveil glimpses of the future. Some believe it grants prophetic visions, while others dismiss it as mere wishful thinking.
- **Dancing Lights in the Desert:** Travellers speak of ethereal lights that dance across the desert sands at night. Locals attribute it to benevolent spirits, while others fear it may be an omen of impending danger.
- **The Silent Guardian of the Oasis:** A guardian, resembling a shimmering warrior, is said to watch over a hidden oasis. It is believed that those with pure intentions may receive guidance, but approaching with malice invites the guardian's wrath.
- **The Cursed Statues of the Grand Plaza:** Whispers circulate about statues in the Grand Plaza that are said to come to life at the stroke of midnight. Some claim these animated figures offer cryptic advice, while others warn of a dark curse.
- **Ephemeral Music on High:** Travellers report hearing enchanting melodies echoing from the peaks of the nearby Mountains. Legend has it that those who follow the music may discover a celestial sanctuary.
- **The Phantom Caravan:** Nomads speak of a phantom caravan that traverses the desert at incredible speeds. It is said to carry treasures from distant lands, and those who witness it may be granted a boon or a curse.
- **The Oracle's Veiled Prophecy:** An enigmatic oracle is said to reside in a concealed chamber beneath the city. Seekers claim that the oracle imparts cryptic prophecies, but gaining access to her presence requires solving an intricate riddle.

### Mirage Oases
During the creation of your Region, you'll have designated certain hexes on the map as Mirage Oases. These are magical phenomena that create unique and strange landscapes. For example, they might be lush vegetation, and sparkling water sources in the midst of the shifting desert, or hot sand dunes and dry canyons within a humid jungle. You can choose the nature and biome of these as you wish - or use the Biome Inspiration table below.

At the beginning of each session, roll a D12 for each Oasis and consult the table below to determine their fates. You can reroll if you've rolled the same effect recently or if for some reason the effect wouldn't be possible. If the Mirage moves, anyone in it also moves with it. 

| D12 | Mirage Change |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | The Mirage is stuck - nothing changes. |
| 2 | The Mirage shifts its nature - it is filled with a deep fog that isn't burnt away by daylight. |
| 3 | Move the Mirage two hexes North. |
| 4 | Move the Mirage two hexes East. |
| 5 | The Mirage shifts its nature - turning into a new biome. |
| 6 | Move the Mirage two hexes South. |
| 7 | Move the Mirage two hexes West. |
| 8 | The Mirage shifts its nature - turning into a new biome. |
| 9 | The Mirage shifts its nature - it is night when the rest of the Region is day, and day when the Region is at night. |
| 10 | The Mirage move 5 hexes in a direction of the GMs choosing. |
| 11 | The Mirage shifts its nature - the Mirage pulls at the fabric of time and the area is pushed back in time 500 years (if the Mirage changes shifts its nature again, all people are returned to their own time). |
| 12 | The Mirage disappears. The GM returns it to the Region, wherever they like, at the end of the session. |

The magical nature of Mirage Oases often attract the attention of nomadic tribes, adventurers, or mystical creatures, so beware, you are unlikely to be alone for very long when exploring them. But exploring them will often come with immense boons as Oases may provide various benefits when discovered, including rare resources, unique encounters, or clues leading to hidden treasures.

### Madinah Map
Though not necessary, if your group enjoyed developing their Region, or if your adventures are particularly focused on the Madinah itself, players may want to create a similar map for the Madinah itself. If they want to do this, you can throw dice over another sheet of paper, and use the following table to populate the city itself. Be sure to draw streets to connect the various places. Include the PCs house or place where they live, and any the abode of any NPC that came up during the Character creation process. 

| Roll | Location |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Town Hall or other important building |
| 2 |  |
| 3 | Water Source |
| 4 | Marketplace or Bazaar |
| 5 | Place of Worship |
| 6 | Caravan Rest Stop or Oasis Retreat |
| 7 |  |
| 8 | Camel Herd or Livestock Grazing Area |
| 9 |  |
| 10 | Alchemical Laboratory or Potion Shop |
| 11 | Nomad Trading Post |
| 12 | Spring or Garden |
| 13 | Water Spirit Shrine |
| 14 | Mystic Enclave or Seer's Abode |
| 15 | Mirage or Illusionary Market |
| 16 | Ancient Ruins or Monuments |
| 17 | Ancient Observatory  |
| 18 | Traveling Mystic Caravan or Fortune Teller |
| 19 | Subterranean Oasis or Underground Springs |
| 20 | Elemental Convergence Zone or Magical Nexus |
If you roll something that doesn’t make sense or roll too many of the same number, feel free to reroll.

After you’ve drawn these onto the map, add the following to the map:
- Each character’s house;
- Any locations that you established in the collaborative town-creation questions, like any sites relevant to important industries, the headquarters of notable local organizations, and any notable landmarks

If there are any other locations that players want to include in the map or any key geographic features like rivers, ocean fronts, hills, or the like, draw those in now. Make sure that you have roads connecting the locations in your town.

Similar to the region map, don't feel pressured to create an stunningly beautiful map. A simple box, circle, or a quick sketch will suffice for this map's purpose in most cases.
