Your player character may need to procure weapons, armour, or other equipment. Rules for this are described below.

### Purchasing Goods

Equipment has a level between 1 and 5 that indicates its availability – how easy it is to acquire. Equipment is mostly obtained through contacts and status, represented by your Resources value (see chapter 2). Your party is expected to procure equipment before leaving on any excursions outside the madinah. When preparing for a trip in this way, each player rolls the number of D6 dice indicated by their character’s Resources value. The number of successes (a six on the roll) is used to purchase equipment – for example, an item with availability level 1 costs one success, while another with level 3 costs three successes. You can donate successes to each other, or add them together to purchase higher level equipment and decide among yourselves who will carry the equipment, regardless of whose successes paid for it. Each player may also decide to move points from their free Capital, but will then have less money to spend while outside of the madinah (see below).

### Shopping inside the madinah

While inside the madinah, PCs are expected to have money, status, or goods that correspond to their respective living standards. When bartering with a non-player character who is reluctant to part with an item, you make an opposed roll for Inspiration and add the Bartering Bonus based on your living standard (table Modifier from Resources). Equipment is bought by achieving a number of successes equal to or greater than the equipment’s availability level.

For normal purchases, from someone willing to sell at a fixed price, the Resources value is rolled to see how much money (or what promise of future payment) the player character is good for. Rich individuals can also automatically purchase equipment by spending Capital (see the Resources Table), as long as it is not done with an opposed roll. The point is spent until the next adventure and can be used instead of a success test or added to increase the number of successes.

### Shopping outside the madinah

Outside your own madinah, individuals will find their status does not go as far. Instead, you'll need to have cash on hand to purchase goods. Rich individuals can automatically purchase equipment while outside their madinah by spending Capital (see the Resources Table), as long as it is not done with an opposed roll. The point is spent until the next adventure and can be used instead of a success test or added to increase the number of successes.


### Resources Table

| Resources |  Living Standards  | Bartering Bonus | Capital |
| :-------: | :----------------: | :-------------: | :-----: |
|     1     |     Destitute      |       -1        |    -    |
|     2     |        Poor        |        -        |    -    |
|     3     |     Struggling     |        -        |    1    |
|     4     | Financially stable |       +1        |    2    |
|     5     |    Middle-class    |       +1        |    3    |
|     6     |      Well-off      |       +2        |    5    |
|     7     |      Wealthy       |       +3        |    8    |
|     8     |    Filthy rich     |       +5        |   12    |

## Body Armour

Body armour can protect you from damage. Armour doesn’t provide protection from other kinds of damage, or from damage you inflict on yourself when you push a roll. The effect of armour is determined by its armour rating, and is measured via dice type (D6, D8, D10, D12) just like attributes and skills. When you suffer damage from a physical attack, roll two dice corresponding to the armour rating. Every success you roll decreases the damage by one. This roll does not count as an action and cannot be pushed.

|Type|Armor Rating|Grace Modifier|Availability|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Light Armour|D6|-1|2|
|Medium Armour|D8|-2|3|
|Heavy Armour|D10|-3|4|

## Equipment & Tools

Tools, weapons, and other items help you by adding a bonus to your skill tests. The bonus indicates the number of extra dice you may roll. See the Equipment list for examples of items from each availability level. You may also visit various establishments or purchase services that can make things easier during the mystery or serve as a place for healing Conditions. Each service applies to the whole party, rather than any individual character. For examples, see the Services and Establishments list. The Weapons table shows a list of weapons the characters might use. Damage indicates how many Conditions the opponent suffers if hit. Range shows which zones you can reach with your attack. Range 0–1 means you can attack enemies in your zone and adjacent zones, while 1–3 means you can attack enemies one, two, or three zones away, but not enemies in your own zone. Bonus indicates how many dice you may add to your success test when trying to hit your enemy. Skill shows which skill to roll for. Availability indicates how difficult the weapon is to obtain.

## Mounts

A horse or other riding animal can be a useful asset. The animal can carry gear for you, and you can take advantage of being in the saddle during combat.

**Movement:** Mounts allow you to move faster in combat than on foot. When making a move action, make a Grace roll – for each success, you may move an additional zone. Mounts generally can’t move into Cramped zones at all. In Cluttered zones, they can only move one zone per action.

**Move:** When you are on horseback and make a Grace roll, use the animal’s Grace instead of your own.

**Bladework:** You can fight from horseback, but only with one-handed weapons. Opponents attacking you must decide if they attack you or the horse. Attacks against a mounted rider suffer a −1 penalty.

**Marksmanship:** All ranged attacks from horseback suffer a −2 modification. Opponents shooting at you must decide if they attack you or the horse.

**Damage:** Your mount can suffer damage, just like you, through attacks or by pushing rolls when you are using the animal’s attribute score. Animals recover damage just like PCs. An animal that has its Strength reduced to zero does not suffer a critical injury, instead it is considered perished. Animals generally don’t have Wits or Empathy.
