Roleplaying is a conversation. The Gamemaster describes the scene, you describe how your PCs behave, the GM describes how any NPCs react, you reply, and it goes back and forth. That is how the story is told and progresses. But sooner or later, a decisive situation will arise, a point of no return, a conflict that conversation alone cannot resolve. Then it’s time to break out the dice and use one of your skills.

## Roll the Dice

There are twelve core skills in total in Mirage, and they are all described later in this chapter. Each skill is connected to one of the four attributes: Strength, Agility, Wits, and Empathy

When it's time to roll, grab two dice – one for your skill level and another for the base attribute that is connected to the skill. These two dice are called your base dice. The type of base dice to roll depends on your levels in the skill and attribute. Then roll your two base dice together.

**Success:** To succeed with your action, you must roll 6 or higher on at least one base die used in the roll. A roll of 6 or higher is called a success. A roll of 10 or higher on a single die (only possible with a D10 or D12) counts as two successes.

**No Skill?** If you don’t have the skill required for the particular action you want to perform, you can roll anyway – simply roll the base die for your attribute alone.

**Gear:** Gear can give positive modifiers or even additional dice to roll.

### Multiple Successes

If you roll two or more successes, you reach your stated goal, but also gain some additional bonus effect, depending on the situation and the skill used. In combat, extra successes can increase the damage done. For other skills, you can suggest a bonus effect yourself. The GM has final say. Some suggestions:

- You act quickly.
- You act quietly.
- You help another character.
- You impress someone.
- You discover something unexpected.

**More Successes:** Rolling three or even more successes generally only matters in combat, where each additional will increase the damage done by one point.

### The Art of Failure

If you roll no successes, something goes wrong. For some reason, you failed to achieve your goal. Feel free to elaborate on why with the help of the GM. They might even let a failed roll have further consequences to move the story forward in a dramatic way. Failure must not stop the story completely. Even when you fail, there must be a way forward – perhaps at the cost of additional time, risk, or resources, but still a way. The GM has the final say regarding the consequences of failure in a particular situation. You have one last chance if you really need to succeed – you can pray.

**Combat:** In combat, the GM doesn’t have to give every failure too much of a consequence. The fact that your attack missed is usually enough, as it is now your enemy’s turn to retaliate. The GM can of course penalize you with extra consequences in combat as well – maybe your missed shot hits someone else instead?

### Dice Names

Whether a certain die you have rolled originates from your attribute, skill, or gear may be important. For that reason, it can be useful to use dice of different colours for the dice. The dice from attributes are called Attribute Dice, the dice from skills are called Skill Dice, and the dice from gear are called Gear Dice.

## Prayer

When your need is most dire, you can pray for help. This means you get to re-roll some or all of your dice that don't show a value of one. The prayer doesn’t count towards your actions in the turn and takes no time to perform. But this doesn’t come without risk, see below. You will usually only pray when your roll has failed, but you could pray even if there were successes in your initial roll, to get more successes and unlock more bonus effects. You can only pray when testing a skill, not for any other roll. You can only pray once for each roll. After praying, you cannot change back to the previous result. All dice count after the prayer, even any dice you didn’t re-roll.

### Preparatory Prayer and Chapels

If you make time for preparatory prayers before lunging into the fray, you get a +1 modifier to re-rolls when you pray anytime later during the session. If the prayer takes place in a temple, your modifier becomes +2. This is in effect for the rest of the session.

### The Cost of Unanswered Prayer

When you pray, you act in faith that your prayers will be answered in your favour, but this may not always be the case. After having prayed, if any of your dice show a one, you suffer a relevant Condition (see below). These do not stack, if your dice show multiple ones on a roll, you receive a single condition. If you've rolled a one during prayer, what attribute you're rolling on matters. When praying during a roll for Strength or Agility, you get a physical condition of your choice. When praying during a roll for Wits or Empathy, you get a mental condition of your choice.

## Conditions

There are two ways to acquire Conditions. You may have to choose one after rolling a one while praying, and you can also get them as a consequence of failing a test (for example, during combat). Acquiring Conditions means that your player character has been negatively affected.

Physical Conditions include **Exhausted**, **Battered**, and **Wounded**, while Mental Conditions include **Angry**, **Frightened**, and **Hopeless**.

Each physical condition you have gives you a −1 modifier to skills rolls using Strength or Agility, while each mental condition gives you −1 to rolls for Wits or Empathy. No matter how many Conditions you have accumulated, you may always roll at least one die. As with all modifiers, these stack.

Conditions can be healed through rest and other activities (see Chapter 5). When you already have three Conditions of the same type and acquire a fourth one, you become Broken (see Chapter 5). This means that you are seriously injured, temporarily insane, or otherwise worn down. You may not perform any actions, physical or mental. In addition, a Broken player character also sustains a critical injury.

### Passive Rolls

You can only pray for skill rolls when you actively perform an action. When passive or unaware, for example when rolling Observation to see if you spot a sneaking enemy, you cannot pray for the roll.

## Only One Chance

As a rule, you only have one chance to succeed with any action. Once you have rolled the dice – and prayed – you may not roll again to achieve the same goal. You need to try something different or wait until the circumstances have changed in a substantial way. Or let another player character try. This rule does not apply to combat, where you can attack the same enemy multiple times.

## Modifiers

Sometimes, external factors help you to succeed. Such modifiers will step your base dice to bigger dice. Other times, something hampers your action. This downsteps your base dice. You can get such modifiers to skill rolls in several different ways: talents, the difficulty of the action itself, and help from others.

A +1 modifier means upgrading a base die one step, a +2 modifier means upgrading two steps, and so on. A −1 modifier means downgrading a base die one step, −2 means two steps down, and so on. Several modifiers can apply to the same roll, and they are cumulative.

When stepping up and down, always try to balance your dice as much as possible – i.e. step up a lower base die first, and downstep a higher base die. You can never go above two D12s, no matter what modifiers you have. To downstep past two D6s, remove one die. You can never go below one D6. If you lack a skill level and start with just a single base die, step up by adding a D6 (as one step up) and step it up further as needed.

### Difficulty

Normally, the GM doesn’t assess how difficult an action is. You only roll dice in challenging situations – period. But sometimes, the GM might want to underscore that external factors either help or hinder an action. Use the adjacent table for guidance.

|Difficulty|Modifier|
|:-:|:-:|
|Trivial|+3|
|Simple|+2|
|Easy|+1|
|Average|0|
|Demanding|-1|
|Hard|-2|
|Formidable|-3|

**Specific Modifiers:** There are also cases when modifications are imposed by the rules, like when you aim carefully with a ranged weapon, shoot at long distance, or if you’re in a bad negotiation position when you attempt to persuade someone. Some talents also give you a positive modifier in certain situations.

## Help From Others

Other PCs or NPCs can help you succeed at a skill roll. This must be declared before you roll your dice. It must also make sense in the story – the individuals helping you must be physically present and have the capacity to support your action. The GM has final say.

For each person helping you, you get a +1 modifier. No more than three people can help you with a single roll, meaning your maximum modifier from getting help is +3. In combat, helping counts as the same type of action as the one you are supporting (fast or slow). NPCs can help each other in the same way as player characters. Letting NPCs act in groups instead of individually is of- ten an easy way to manage large numbers of NPCs in combat

## Parallel Actions

When you are doing things at the same time, you cannot help each other. If all of you are trying to sneak past someone or avoid sinking into a swamp, each of you must pass your own test without assistance from the others. However, some skills allow a character whose test is extra successful to give successes to others (see Extra Successes), and help them that way instead.

## Opposed Rolls

Sometimes, rolling a success isn’t enough to succeed with your skill roll. In some cases, you must beat your opponent in an opposed roll. To win an opposed roll, you must roll more successes than your adversary. Every success rolled by your adversary eliminates one of your successes. Only you (the active party) can push your roll – and you can decide to do so even after your opponent rolls.

Sometimes you and your adversary roll for different skills, sometimes the same. Opposed can be used when you roll Inspiration versus Intuition to influence someone who is actively trying to resist you, or Shadowcraft versus Observation to move undetected past a vigilant guard. The GM can also use opposed rolls in any case when they deem it appropriate.

Ties: If you and your opponent roll the same number of successes, the result is a tie. Typically, your action will fail if you roll a tie as the active party in an opposed roll, but in some cases, ties have specific effects. If a tie needs to be broken, re-roll the opposed roll to determine the outcome.

> [!note] NPCs and Skills 
> Non-Player Characters use skills in the same way as player characters. The GM rolls dice for them, and they can push their rolls just like PCs can. But the GM only has to roll for actions that affect a PC directly – for example, if the NPC is attacking a player character or is attempting to save them. When an NPC performs an action that does not directly affect a PC, the GM can simply decide what happens, without rolling dice.
