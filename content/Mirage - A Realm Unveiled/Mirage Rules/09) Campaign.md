# Running Campaigns

Games of Mirage are not only intended to invoke feelings of wonder and excitement, but also a sense of nostalgia - as if you and your players were right in the midst of a grand story, told around the campfire late at night. To this end, we've compiled some suggestions for you that should help encourage this atmosphere.

### Stories from childhood
Al-Sarab should feel foreign and fantastical, while still feeling relatable. One way we suggest doing this is a small change to terminology, but one that seems to make a big difference, namely, using tried and true storytelling tropes. Games of Mirage are told in Chapters and we refer to the the first couple of sessions as the "Prologue" - a renaming of a common tool usually referred to as "Session 0".

### Your Prologue
The first thing to note when it comes to the Prologue is to acknowledge that it is part of the game. You'll be creating characters, developing relationships, and filling out your Madina in your prologue. This isn't the things you do "before" you start playing the "real" game. The prologue is an integral and meaningful part of your games, so we recommend not rushing through it in order to "start" playing - you're already playing, so get stuck in! 

### Chapters
As said above, games of Madina are played in Chapters. You'll notice that the campaign found in this book makes use of this terminology. This means that you play through a scenario, and when it ends, the Gamemaster “cuts” and proceeds to the next one. You do not have to play every single thing that happens – only what you feel is important. The Gamemaster decides when a chapter starts and when it ends. An easy way to differentiate this is to actually say it out loud to your players; "And so we begin Chapter 2, Into the Ruins.... "

### Flashbacks
A really common storytelling trope is to embed stories within stories. This can often get over complicated inside a roleplaying game though. One way you can introduce this idea, though, is through the use of flashbacks. If a player references something that happened to their character in the past (maybe something that helps them solve a current problem), feel free to use a "flashback". This will involve actually roleplaying that moment in time, "pausing" what's currently occurring so as to build in that minor moment in the PCs history. Beware though, this can often exclude others at the table, so make these flashbacks brief and to the point, and avoid doing them in combat. 

> [!example] Example
> - GM: As you're traversing through the dense forest, you stumble upon a peculiar-looking stone altar hidden amidst the foliage.
> - PC 1: Ah, this reminds me of the time when I was traveling alone in the wilderness. I stumbled upon a similar altar deep in the heart of the mountains.
> - GM: Well, let's work out how that happened! Tell me, what does your character remember of that moment?
> - PC 1: I remember the chill of the mountain air, the sound of the wind howling through the peaks. The altar stood before me, ancient and weathered, adorned with mysterious symbols.
> - GM: A voice whispers on the wind, barely audible yet unmistakably ancient. "Seek the truth that lies within, wanderer," it says. The words echo in your mind, lingering like a cryptic riddle.
> - PC 1: With determination, I approached the altar, my heart pounding with anticipation and apprehension.
> - GM: As you draw closer, a faint glow emanates from the symbols etched upon the stone, casting eerie shadows in the fading light of day. You feel a surge of energy coursing through your veins, as if the very essence of the mountain itself is awakening.
> - PC 1: I reached out, trembling slightly, and placed my hand upon the surface of the altar, ready to unravel the mysteries it held.
> - GM: And that's where we'll pause for now. As you stand there, hand upon the ancient altar, the memory fades, and you find yourself back in the present, the forest around you alive with the sounds of nature.

These are just guidelines though, if you've had experience in GMing or know what your own group prefers, feel free to pace out your adventure how you see fit.

# Learning to Read

*A mischievous jinn, freed by a child's wish, throws a desert madinah into chaos by weakening the magical anchor stabilising its reality. As the village faces shifting mirages and unsettling dreams, brave adventurers delve into ancient ruins, seeking answers and encountering twisted echoes of past wishes. The jinn, manipulating the situation for its own amusement, offers a dark bargain: fulfil its desires and it will restore order. However, a deeper truth emerges - the Simurgh, a powerful creature drawn to the child's loneliness, also disrupts the anchor with its presence. Torn between confronting the Jinn directly or rescuing the child from the Simurgh's realm, the heroes must tread a perilous path to unravel the Jinn's true motive, break the cycle of wishes, and restore harmony to the village before the chaos consumes everything.*

## Additions to the Prologue

In your prologue, the players will go through the madinah creation phase, as per usual, before moving onto the next section - The Marketplace. If you opt to do this, you can skip the rumours section if you'd prefer to have less complications within your campaign. If they have opted to skip the process of creating a madinah, then you can use the following information instead:

> [!important] Al-Nisa
> Al-Nisa, a reasonably-sized madinah located in a lush valley, is known for its skilled weavers and vibrant festivals. It is located in region of Saraundar and surrounded by desert. It is reasonably well-off, with it's markets usually full of travellers and merchants that brave the changing environments of Al-Sarab.
> 
> Recently a shifting Mirage has enveloped the town. Although this does present challenges to those entering and existing the town, ultimately Al-Nisa's anchor keeps the town safe.
> > Be sure to roll on the Biome Inspiration table to determine what the mirage is doing at the start of the campaign. 
> 

## Post-Chapter Conversations

Each section of this adventure includes "Post-Chapter Conversations". These are meant to be covered at the end of a session - each time you get together as a group. You should leave room at the end of a session for these conversations - 15 minutes is a good place to start, but as players grow more comfortable sharing you will need to increase this time. If you manage to get through multiple chapters in a session, you may even have a few options for what to ask your players, though there is no need to read through every single question if you've gone through multiple chapters - just choose ones you think were the most interesting or impactful. 

# The Marketplace


> [!quote] The Marketplace
> The midday sun blazes overhead, baking the bustling marketplace. Laughter mingles with the rhythmic chants of vendors, their colourful stalls overflowing with spices, woven tapestries, and exotic wares. Sometimes, familiar faces greet you as you navigate the throng, and voices of friend and stranger weave a comforting tapestry of daily life..
> 
>  Yet, beneath the sun's relentless heat, a disquiet stirs, and a strange stillness descends. The air hangs heavy, thick with an unnatural warmth. The birds, usually a chorus of chirps and whistles, fall silent, their absence leaving an unsettling void. As you make your way through the market, whispers of unsettling dreams and visions ripple through the crowd, like ripples disturbing a serene pool.
> 
> Why are you here in the marketplace today?

After allowing the players some time to talk about what is going on with them, read the following:

> [!quote] The Shift
> While the party makes their way around the area, they pass by the Alwataq - the location of the madinah's protective anchoring crystal. Suddenly, the air around you takes on an edge. A shiver goes through the party, from the direction of the Alwataq, and the air above madinah  *flickers* with a magical energy. The crowd around you murmurs and some people even leave the marketplace in a hurry.

(You'll want to describe the biome outside the Madinah here. If you forgot to roll on the Biome Inspiration table before starting, do so now and describe what the players see outside the protective anchor.)

> [!info] The nature of the anchor
> A madinah's anchor protects the area from the change-magic of Al-Sarab. But the environment outside this protective shield is very much visible from the inside of the protective magic. If a madinah is located inside a desert, and a rogue mirage turns the outside area into a jungle, the denizens of the madiah can see the jungle. 

>[!quote]  .
> Just as the crowd starts to settle, you hear a frustrated shout come from within the Alwataq. At the same time, a young girl, running up to you, starts to beg you for help - babbling about some child.
>
What do you do?

> [!warning] Split-party
> If you find that the party splits up in an attempt to cover both of their bases, you can allow this if you'd like. If you'd prefer to keep it simple, the young girl actually goes to into the Alwataq for help. After being reunited, if the party splits yet again, the young girl grows frantic on her way through the crowds, and actually loses those going with her in the throng of people attempting to go home after all the excitement of the anchor flickering. 
## The Young Girl

A frantic girl, eyes wide with worry, bursts through the crowd. They move away from, or ignore, her - it's clear shes not well-off. "My Zahir," she gasps, "he's gone! Vanished! Please help me! All I found was this..." They thrust a crumpled parchment towards you, revealing a child's scrawled message: 

> [!note] "I found a friend, but it's too big for here."

The young woman goes by Amira. She will say that she is family to Zahir, while attempting to avoid any particulars. She readily describes Zahir though (small, about 10, black hair and deep green eyes) and says that it is unlike him to disappear in such a way. Additionally, importantly... Zahir cannot write. 

> [!info] Amira Amin
> Amira lives on the streets with Zahir. They are almost certainly unrelated, though this cannot be confirmed in any meaningful way - she claims to be his cousin. Bar physical violence, she will not reveal that Zahir, or herself, are street kids, as she's scared the party won't help her if they know this. She claims that Zahir's shelter is simply a place they play. She claims to not know where he lives as "they just moved." She won't bring the party to her family if asked, as that would "get her in trouble". She is willing to pay, but says that she'll need to work to find the resources to do so. 
> She doesn't actually know Zahir very well, but he's a good thief, and he helps her get food. Without his help, her life will be exceedingly worse - probably resulting her entering "the Silks."

If the party decides to help Amira, she will take them to Zahir's makeshift shelter outside the market's edge, a collection of scavenged materials offering meagre protection from the elements hidden on the top of a derelict building. 

Inside the home, the players will find that the walls are covered in drawings. Of anything and everything, from market scenes, pictures of people dancing, creatures, jinn, and monsters, star signs, and even a small picture of a girl with a resemblance to Amira. Close attention (Observation success) will result in them seeing two spaces to sleep (far apart) and other evidence (multiple places around a badly-repaired table) pointing to more than one person living here. Multiple successes of a lot of attention by players will reveal that the space is taken care of, the contents may be sparse, old, and often broken - but its clean and anything that can be fixed, has been. 

As the players attempt to learn more about Zahir, a faint shimmer distorts the air near the shelter's entrance. A small creature with shimmering wings and glowing eyes materialises. To some, it will appear as a small human, wearing a diaphanous dress and a colourful khimar. Others will see a white bird with a colourful under-wing.

The aaperi, seems to be intrigued by the players' investigation, and offers veiled hints - cooing whenever they pay attention to the more mythical drawings and crying at the picture of Amira. In exchange for a small offering (a shiny charm, a sweet treat), it will reveal:

- Zahir found an old brass bottle in the ruins outside the madinah.  
- The bottle held a djinn, and Zahir wished for a friend that truly understood him.
- Zahir and the jinn vanished together, leaving only the chilling message.

>[!quote] The aaperi teases
The aaperi clearly thinks that, to find Zahir, they will need to venture to the ruins outside the madinah - either in search of the boy himself, or more clues. It suggests they start with "the library".

## Guardian of the Anchor

Just outside the Alwataq you find an elderly gentleman slumped against the outer wall of the building. Farid is known throughout the village as the guardian of the anchor, the one entrusted with maintaining the delicate balance that protects the settlement from the changing nature of Al-Sarab, and more importantly at this time, the chaos of the shifting mirage just outside the madinah's walls. 

The elder, their weathered face etched with concern, looks up as you approach. "What did you see? What happened out here?"

> [!info] Inside the Alwataq
Inside the building a large crystal, 7 feet high, is set inside the floor. The ground is covered in metallic runes, and clockwork or crystalwork contraptions can be found on shelves and workbenches that cover the walls. The building is domed, and above the crystal a beautiful painting of the night sky, stars and all, can be found. It shimmers, and an Culture check will confirm that it moves and changes to reflect the real sky. 

Farid will confide in the party, in private within the Alwataq, only if they swear an oath of secrecy. "The anchor," they rasp, their voice laced with urgency, "it weakens. Our shield against the shifting sands falters - and I do not know what to do." The party is *very* unlikely to know more than Farid in this matter, but he will provide more context if they can calm him down or convince him in some other way. The anchor has failed in the past, but always because of some 'natural' reason - the moons aligning, or an Al-Mi'raj getting into the building. After verbally processing, Farid will consider something new - what if it's something *unseen*. If this is the case, he's not the right person to talk to. Farid's pride hangs in the balance here. He has kept the madinah safe for decades, it failing now in his old age will only make others pity him and he'll be replaced. 

> [!info] Al-Mi'raj
> A rabbit-like creature with a single horn. Present in a lot of stories, and usually mischievous and funny. They sometimes get into places they shouldn't and their troublesome magic can interfere with an anchor, causing it to malfunction until the creature is removed. 

Farid will inform the players that, if they would like to help keep the madinah safe, he needs some information from a reclusive mystic rumoured to live deep within the desert. He goes by Abyad. This mystic might possess knowledge of anything from beyond the veil that could be causing this. If all else fails, he might even know of ancient rituals or forgotten magic to strengthen the weakening anchor.

## Post-Chapter Conversations

### General Questions 
- **How did the unusual events in the marketplace make your character feel about their role in the community?** 
	- *Exploration of duty: This question prompts players to reflect on their characters' sense of responsibility towards the community and how they perceive their own place within it, touching upon themes of honour and duty.*

### Questions around Amira
- When confronted with Amira's plea and the mystery of Zahir's disappearance, how did your character balance the desire to help with the risk of getting involved in unknown dangers? 
	- *Discussion of courage: This question prompts players to consider how their characters weigh the risks and rewards of helping others, and whether they demonstrate courage in the face of uncertainty.*
- Upon discovering Zahir's shelter and the evidence of his disappearance, what thoughts or emotions did your character experience regarding the plight of those less fortunate? 
	- *Reflection on empathy: This question encourages players to empathise with the struggles of marginalised characters like Zahir and Amira, prompting discussions about empathy and compassion. Where do you think that desire to show compassion comes from?*


### Questions around Farid
- When faced with Farid's plea for secrecy regarding the anchor's condition, how did your character balance the importance of confidentiality with the need for transparency and accountability?
	- Discussion of honour and integrity: This question prompts players to consider their characters' integrity and sense of honour in maintaining secrecy while also acknowledging the potential consequences of withholding information.

# Into the Ruins

Regardless of what interests the players most, they will eventually end up following clues or the requests of others to exit the safety of the madinah, and travel to the ruins just outside the city.

Getting to the ruins outside the madinah is not particularly complex, the way to it is usually straightforward (unless the mirage has changed the region to such a degree that occludes it in some way). As the group approaches, they do find large crystals on the way. These are "dead" - they hold no power, but etched on their surface is decades of graffiti. The entire middle section of each of these is untouched by vandals or teens though, and carries a clear warning:

> [!note] First Worshippers Site Ahead. Beware. Do not Approach. Danger.

> [!quote] Into the Ruins (assumes a desert biome - make relevant changes to account for current biome)
> As you step forth into this realm of forgotten whispers and crumbling stone, a sense of age and mystery envelopes you. Sunlight filters through the skeletal remains of once grand structures, casting long shadows upon the sand that carpets the ground. Massive statues, now worn and weather-beaten, stand as silent sentinels, their features eroded by the sands of time. Beware the yawning passageways that beckon, for beneath the shifting dunes lie hidden depths that echo with the secrets of bygone ages. Among these ruins, the legacy of the First Worshippers lingers, their presence a specter haunting these forsaken halls. 

As the players delve deeper into the ruins, either in search of the mystic Abyad or in search of clues surrounding the disappearance of Zahir, they'll eventually come across the library.

> [!quote] Into the library
> As you descend into the depths, the air grows heavy with the weight of history, mingling with the faint scent of ancient tomes and the lingering essence of time itself. You finally enter what appears to be an ancient library. The flickering torchlight reveals rows of towering bookshelves, their timeworn volumes adorned with faded runes and cryptic symbols that speak of mysteries long concealed.
> 
> Standing as a silent guardian at the threshold is majestic statue wrought from the very stones of the earth. Carved with masterful precision, the sentinel seems to watch over the sacred repository with unwavering vigilance, a stoic visage bearing witness to the passage of countless ages. Embedded crystals catch the dim light, casting shimmering reflections that dance across the chamber like ethereal specters.

## The Protector

The statue at the centre of this library is, in fact, a golem - a piece of ancient technology, completely beyond what's currently possible in Al-Sarab. If players progress through the library without touching anything, then the construct remains inert. If the players touch the statue, or any book within the library, the statue will stand up straight, turning its head to "look" at the players. If they continue in whatever initially brought them to the attention of the sentinel, it will move to defend the area. On a successful Observation or Culture check the party notes that the golem walks with a limp, and is slow to bring itself to bare against the party.  

### Broken Golem

### Searching the Library
A successful Culture check on the shit-down sentinel will reveal that it has markings on it that resemble the anchor's energy flow. Deciphering these markings might reveal how to strengthen an anchor - if they had knowledge of such things. 

A successful Observation (multiple needed if in combat) check while searching the library for information on the construct will reveal a scroll documenting how it can be "changed". It seems that the only real thing that can be altered is *what* it protects, not how it protects, or how severe its actions will be.

A successful Observation (multiple needed if in combat) check while searching the library for information on anchors will reveal a partially destroyed tome on the anchor's construction and maintenance. They discover the anchor requires specific magical materials to function at full capacity, materials now depleted and scattered due to natural disasters or forgotten conflicts.


## The Jinn

**Following Zahir's Trail:**

1. **Whispering Cave:** The ruins lead the players to a hidden cave pulsating with faint magical energy. Inside, they discover ancient murals depicting a jinn granting wishes and the consequences of unchecked desires.
2. **Echoes of Wishes:** As they explore deeper, they encounter spectral echoes of past wishes granted by the Jinn, showcasing both positive and catastrophic outcomes. This reinforces the Jinn's duplicitous nature and the potential dangers involved.
3. **Jinn's Lair:** Deep within the cave, they find a hidden chamber – the Jinn's lair. Here, they encounter Shahin, the mischievous Jinn, lounging amidst stolen treasures and shimmering trinkets.


- **The Jinn's Motive:** Driven by boredom and a twisted sense of amusement, Shahin manipulated Zahir and used his wish to weaken the anchor, creating chaos and disruption. It gains power from both the chaos and the weakening anchor, intending to use it to escape its earthly confines.
- **Zahir's Plight:** The child is trapped within the Jinn's realm, experiencing fantastical experiences meant to keep him distracted while the Jinn furthers its plan.
- **Unraveling the Mystery:** Combining clues from both paths – the echoes of past wishes, the forgotten archive, and the tainted pool – the players understand the Jinn's true motive and the anchor's vulnerability.

**Additional elements to consider:**

- Introduce rival groups seeking to exploit the weakened anchor for their own gain, forcing the players to make uneasy alliances or navigate treacherous power struggles.
- Offer the players a chance to directly confront the Jinn through negotiation, trickery, or combat, depending on their skills and preferences.
- Allow them to utilize the knowledge from the ruins to find the needed materials or perform a ritual to cleanse the pool and strengthen the anchor.

**Remember, Act 2 is about focusing the mystery, raising the stakes, and allowing the players to make key decisions that shape the final act.** Tailor the encounters and challenges to their backstories and skills, while keeping the tension high and the narrative engaging as they move closer to confronting the Jinn and saving the village.

OKay, I like this. Given that the Jinn is out of the bottle, he can now interact with the world again. Allowing him to find the ruins, and make a home for himself. It can be all magical and wonderful to look at and confusing for the players. It also means that the boy is "stuck" in the spiritual world, and too distracted with the Simurgh to make any more wishes, which might mean the Jinn is returned to the bottle, or some other unfortunate fate.

Our players arrive in the ruins, and maybe even work out some of these details. Maybe they even meet the Jinn. But what happens? They can't beat the Jinn outright at this stage or risk teh plot reaching a climax too early, so what needs to occur?

# Beyond the Veil

Zahir is with the Simurgh
Simurgh tells them that Zahir is learning to write
Need evidence for anchor being damaged to help with Farid's pride. 
(Wishes vs Work)

# Jinn Confrontation

Beat the tricky Jinn, Zahir makes second wish to escape the realm.
Contruct is instated to protect the entrance

# Return to the Madinah

Although the anchor is safe now, the madina is horribly damaged (third wish)?
