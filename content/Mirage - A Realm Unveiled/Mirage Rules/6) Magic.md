What most people call magic is a catch-all term for forces at work behind the veil of the world, beyond what the common folk understand or dare perceive. Magic is a wild and unreliable force that can manifest itself in many ways. There are no schools of magic, instead knowledge is transferred from master to apprentice in a number of broad categories, called disciplines. Awareness, Healing, and Shapeshifting, Elementalism, and Symbolism. Every discipline is linked to a tiered Talent (see Chapter 4), that is a prerequisite to be able to cast spells within each discipline.

### Learning Magic

To learn a new discipline, or increase your rank in a discipline you already know, you should find a master with a higher rank than you in the magic specialty and who is ready to share their secrets with you. This could require both persuasion and substantial compensation. With a teacher, the cost in XP for increasing the rank in a magical specialty or learning a new one is 10 XP. Without a teacher, the cost is 30 XP.

## Spells Casting

Your attempts to use magic to impose your will on the world are called spells. A large number of spells are described later in this chapter. You can also write your own spells under the watchful eye of your GM.

### Spell Ranks

Spells are rated in ranks ranging from 1 to 3. There can be spells of even higher rank. As a magic user, you can cast all spells that are at a rank equal to or lower than your rank in the related magical talent.

**Chance Casting:** If you really want to, you can cast a spell at one rank above the rank of your magical talent. However, this comes at a great risk, as you will automatically suffer a random magic mishap in this case. You can never cast a spell that is two ranks or more above your talent rank.

### Casting a Spell

Casting a spell is generally a slow action in combat, but there are also so-called power words that are fast actions. Another type of spell are rituals that take a longer time to cast. Whether or not a spell is a power word or ritual is detailed under each spell.

Unlike skills, you can never fail at casting a spell. Instead, you can choose to roll a skill roll in an attempt to increase the effectiveness or power of the spell. The skill used is detailed under each spell, sometimes an option is given and the Player chooses which skill to use when this is the case. Multiple success results in a more powerful spell effect.

**Safe Casting:** You do not need to make a skill roll when casting - this is called safe casting. If you choose to safe cast, the power level of the spell is considered 1.

**Power Level:** If you do choose to make a skill roll, the number and type of successes you get will add to the spell's initial power level of 1. Overcharging, other dice rolls, and other factors can further modify the power level.

**Overcharging:** When you cast a spell, every roll of a 10 or higher increases its power level by one, on top of the initial increase due to rolling a success. This is called overcharging.

> [!example] Example
For example, if you choose to make a skill roll while casting a spell and roll a 5 and a 9 (one success), then its power level is 2 (the one success adds to the initial power level of 1). If you rolled a 6 and a 7 (two successes), then the power level is 3. If you rolled a 7 and a 10 (a standard success and an overcharged one), the power level is 4. Finally, if you rolled a 10 and an 11 (two overcharged successes), then the power level is a 5.

**Magic Mishap**: If you choose to make a skill roll, and you roll a 1, you have unleashed powerful forces but are unable to control them and you suffer a magic mishap. Roll D66 on the table found below.

**Range:** Every spell has a range, which denotes the maximum distance at which it can be cast. The range Personal means the spell only affects yourself.

**Duration:** Every spell has a duration. Immediate means that the effect is instantaneous and does not last.

#### Magic Mishaps

|D12 Effect|Outcome|
|:-:|:-:|
|11-13|The magic makes you unable to sleep for D6 days.|
|22-23|The magic roots you to the ground, you cannot make a move action for two turns. You can do other actions.|
|14-15|Your spell drains your energy, inflicting one point of stress.|
|16-21|Your body and mind are so overcome with the uncontrolled magical power that it takes everything you have to hold yourself together. You cannot do anything for until the end of next round - you must act last, after all PCs and enemies.|
|24-25|Your magic hurts your mind, and you suffer one mental condition|
|26-31|Your magic hurts your body, and you suffer one physical condition|
|36-41|The spell triggers a magical disease. Roll an opposed roll with the GM, the GM uses 2D6. If you fail, you and everyone within melee range of you for the next quarter-day are exposed to the contagion.|
|42-45|The spell also affects a friend or other unintended victim. A healing or helping spell affects an enemy alongside the intended target.|
|46|Your magic permanently alters your appearance. The GM decides how.|
|51|The spell blinds you. You act as in total darkness for the next full day.|
|52-55|The spell ravages your mind. Immediately roll for a mental critical injury.|
|56|The force of the magic breaks bones in your body. Immediately roll for a physical critical injury.|
|61|Your magic attracts the curiosity of a div. The div appears within the next day and will create all kinds of trouble.|
|62-65|The spell backfires. An offensive spell affects you instead of your intended target. A protective or healing spell wounds instead of healing. A shapeshift goes horribly wrong and you become a dumb animal. A summoned undead, div, or illusion turns against you. The GM specifies the details.|
|66|Your magic rips open a rift in the fabric of the material realm, and an iftrit pulls you over to the other side. Time to make a new character. Your old character will come back as an NPC after D66 days but will be… changed.|

> [!faq] Grimoires
You don’t need your spells written down to cast them, but it makes it easier to get it right. Grimoires are highly sought-after artifacts among magic users. If you cast a spell from a book or a scroll, its rank is considered one step lower than usual. In combat, you must spend a fast action readying your grimoire before you can cast each spell. Writing down a spell requires that you first cast it once. Then, you must spend at least a Quarter Day with quill in hand and make a successful Culture roll. Writing down a ritual takes two Quarter Days.

### Range Categories

|Range|Description|
|:-:|:-:|
|Personal|Yourself|
|Engaged|Right next to you|
|Short|A few meters away, in the same zone as you|
|Medium|Up to 25 meters away, in an adjacent zone|
|Long|Up to about one hundred meters (four zones) away|
|Extreme|Up to about one kilometre|

## General Spells

_The magic disciplines differ, but there are certain effects and spells that all magic users can use if skilled enough. These are called general spells. They also come in ranks, but you can use any magic discipline to cast them._

### Magical Shield

- Skill: Observation (Wits), Might (Strength), Culture (Wits)
- Rank 1
- Range: Engaged
- Duration: Quarter Day

Using this spell, you protect a person or a location (no bigger than a human) from magic. The power level of any spells cast against that person or place during the Quarter Day is decreased by the power level of the Magical Shield to a minimum of 1 with the exception of Power Words with a power level of 1 - which have no effect.

### Sense Magic

- Skill: Observation (Wits), Survival Instincts (Wits)
- Rank 1
- Range: Medium
- Duration: Immediate

As someone sensitive to magic, you usually sense whenever someone uses magic within Short range or if an item you hold is charged with magical power. If you want to know more about what kind of magic is involved, you must cast the Sense Magic spell. Using this spell is also required to detect Obscured magic (see below) – your power level must then be equal to or higher than the power level of the Obscure Magic spell.

### Obscure Magic

- Shadowcraft (Agility), Grace (Agility), Culture (Wits)
- Rank 2
- Range: Personal
- Duration: Immediate

If you want to cast a spell unnoticed, you must Obscure your magic. This requires an additional success that does not count toward the power level of the spell, or an overcharged success. Obscuring magic does not count as an action in itself. To detect your Obscured spell, another magic user must actively survey the area by casting Sense Magic.

### Dispel Magic

- Grace (Agility), Intuition (Empathy), Observation (Wits)
- Rank 2, Power Word
- Range: Medium
- Duration: Immediate

You can interfere with the spells cast by other magic users. This spell is reactive and breaks the turn order of combat in the round (see Interruptions in Chapter 5). You decrease the power level of your opponent’s spell with the power level of your Dispel. If the result is zero or less, your opponent’s spell has no effect. Mishaps still occur.

### Bind Magic

- Culture (Wits)
- Rank 3, Ritual
- Range: Personal
- Duration: Varies

Skilled magic users can Bind spells to objects to create magical traps or powerful magical artefacts. You cast the spell like any other, but you must make an Culture roll and gain at least one success. This does not count toward the power level of the original spell but binds your spell to an object - instead of unleashing its power immediately. Rituals cannot be Bound. Roll for any mishaps when the spell is Bound. When cast at a power level of 2, the magic lingers for one day, or until the spell is triggered. At a power level 3 the magic lingers forever, but dissipates when the spell is triggered. Power level 4 binds the spell to the object forever and it can be triggered once per day. You can bind the spell in whatever manner you wish. You decide how the spell is triggered. Common methods include a certain phrase being uttered or that the object is opened, broken, or thrown to the ground. Once the spell is triggered, it has the same effect as if it had been cast normally. You cannot bind a spell to a living creature.

### Transfer

- Grace (Agility), Intuition (Empathy), Observation (Wits)
- Rank 3
- Range: Engaged
- Duration: Immediate

You can use this spell to steal successes on casting rolls from others or to give your successes on casting rolls to someone else. Usually, this will essentially increase or decrease the power level of the original spell. You will need to make the skills roll but you can give any successes to whomever you want. You can use this spell as an interruption, to steal successes from an enemy caster. If your target opposes the spell, it is not so easy – in this case, you can Transfer no more successes than the power level of the spell. Overcharged successes are also transferred.

## Awareness

_Magic users who practice Awareness can see what others cannot see, hear what others cannot hear. They can see what has happened in the past and sense what will happen in the future_

### Lightbringer

- Observation (Wits)
- Rank 1
- Range: Short
- Duration: One Quarter Day per power level

You summon a bright light that dispels all shadows within Short range, i.e., in the same zone as you.

### True Sight

- Observation (Wits), Survival Instincts (Wits)
- Rank 1
- Range: Extreme
- Duration: Round

You can enhance your vision to be unnaturally sharp, and see details at Extreme range as if you stood right next to the object in question. True Sight also lets you see in darkness, through smoke and fog, and automatically see through any kind of disguise or shapeshift. You must have a clear line of sight to whatever you want to look at.

### Words on the Wind

- Observation (Wits), Survival Instincts (Wits)
- Rank 1
- Range: Extreme
- Duration: One Quarter Day per power level

You can enhance your hearing magically and hear specific sounds up to Extreme range as clearly as if you stood right where they emanate from. You must see the place to which you direct your hearing.

### Farsight

- Observation (Wits), Survival Instincts (Wits)
- Rank 2
- Range: Varies
- Duration: Quarter Day

You can let your inner eye wander across vast distances, over oceans and land, mountains, and valleys, and see what is happening there right now. Farsight does not help you find a place – you must know where it is located to be able to see it. Power level 1 lets you view a place at Long range. Power level 2 reaches about 10 kilometers. Further away requires power level 3. Viewing a location that you haven’t been to before increases the required power level by one. Your visions are often fragmented and cryptic – the GM decides exactly what you can see.

### True Path

- Intuition (Empathy)
- Rank 2
- Range: Personal
- Duration: Immediate

This spell can guide you to the right path when you face a difficult decision. Once you have cast the spell, the GM must tell you which decision or choice she believes is the wisest.

### Visions of the Past

- Observation (Wits)
- Rank 2
- Range: Medium
- Duration: Quarter Day

You can see events that have transpired in the past at the location where you are, even if those events are no longer remembered by any living being. Power level 1 lets you see one day back in time, power level 2 one year into the past, and power level 3 lets you see hundreds of years back. Your visions are often fragmented and cryptic – the GM decides exactly what you can see.

### Divination

- Observation (Wits), Intuition (Empathy)
- Rank 3, Ritual
- Range: Short
- Duration: Stretch

Performing a ritual, you can see visions of the future. You ask the GM questions about yourself or someone else present. The GM answers as best she can. The answer must be brief, and is often ambiguous and cryptic. The answer can also come in the form of a sign of happiness, or a foreboding sign of ill fortune.

> [!danger] The Problem of Clairvoyance
A PC that can cast Divination can make a mess of the GM’s plans. If the goal of the scenario is to find someone or to reveal the identity of a killer, the PC can just solve the puzzle right off the bat, using this spell. Not fun. The best way to handle this is to give the PC vague clues instead of hard facts - mystical powers are not an exact science. Try to give the PC a clue that feels valuable, but one that won’t ruin the mystery.

### Intuition

- Observation (Wits), Intuition (Empathy)
- Rank 3
- Range: Personal
- Duration: Immediate

You can ask a short “yes” or “no” question about anything in the world. The GM must answer “yes,” “no,” or “maybe.” They cannot lie. The GM can choose “maybe” even if they know the answer but believes that the true answer may disrupt the game. Note that true or false is not an objective fact but is defined by who is asking the question.

### Telepathy

- Intuition (Empathy)
- Rank 3
- Range: Short
- Duration: Stretch

You can read the surface thoughts of another person for a few minutes. Digging deeper for memories is harder and requires power level 2 or even more, depending on how fresh the memory is. You can also use this spell to send your own thoughts to another person. In that case, the range of the spell is Long if you know the target well. By sending thoughts of pain and suffering, you can inflict mental Conditions equal to the power level. This spell has no effect on monsters.

## Healing

*A true calling for some, there are some magic users that believe that the purpose of their lives is to further nature’s cause and to heal its wounds wherever they appear.*

### Cleanse Spirit

- Healing (Empathy)
- Rank 1
- Range: Engaged
- Duration: Immediate

You can focus the forces of nature to enlighten dark souls. You immediately heal an amount of Mental Conditions equal to the power level. You cannot heal yourself.

- Healing (Empathy), Survival Instincts (Wits)
- Rank 1

This spell inflicts damage equal to the power level on a div. This includes divs that do not suffer damage from physical weapons.

### Mend Wounds

- Rank 2
- Range: Short
- Duration: Immediate

This spell inflicts damage equal to the Power Level on one undead target.

### Resurrection

- Healing (Empathy), Inspiration (Empathy)
- Rank 3
- Range: Engaged
- Duration: Immediate

You can channel nature’s forces to resurrect a dead person – not as undead, but truly alive. The more time that has passed since the target died, the more difficult it is. Within the same Quarter Day requires power level 1, within a full day requires power level 2, and within a week requires power level 3. If over a week has passed, the body is too decomposed to be resurrected. A person brought back to life decreases their Empathy attribute by one step permanently (to a minimum of D6), as having seen the world beyond the veil will change their outlook on life forever.

### Serenity

- Inspiration (Empathy)
- Rank 3
- Range: Short
- Duration: Immediate

You spread harmony and serenity around you with this spell, which helps you in social conflicts. The victim of the spell will do what you want, without a roll to persuade them.

### Weathermaster

- Culture (Wits), Survival Instincts (Wits)
- Rank 3
- Range: Extreme
- Duration: Quarter Day

You are so in tune with the forces of nature that you can summon a drastic weather shift in the area where you are. A minor shift, from cloudy to rain or from dead calm to a light breeze, requires power level 1. Unusual weather phenomena that still stay within what is apt for the season – a snowstorm in winter, blazing heat in the summer, or hard winds and lashing rains in the fall – require power level 2. To summon completely unnatural weather, such as a snowstorm in the summer or a heatwave in the middle of winter, requires power level 3.

## Shapeshifting

_Some magic users are closely connected to nature, and the shapeshifters are even more so in their aspiration to be one with nature. Shapeshifting means taking the form of an animal. While there are magic users who have truly mastered this art, there is a broad spectrum of spells in the Shapeshifting discipline that all relate to animals and their aspects in different ways_

### Animal Speech

- Inspiration (Empathy)
- Rank 1
- Range: Short
- Duration: Stretch

This spell allows you to speak with a mammal. You can ask a number of questions equal to the power level of the spell. The animal can tell you what it has seen, heard, or smelled – but they do not perceive the world as humanoids do, so their answers are often hard to interpret. The main advantage is that they never lie.

### Cat’s Paw

- Shadowcraft (Agility)
- Rank 1
- Range: Personal
- Duration: Immediate

You can meld your mind with the spirit of the cat and move without a sound. You can cast this spell instead of rolling Shadowcraft, and you will succeed automatically. Each power level counts as one success.

### Hawk’s Eye

- Observation (Wits)
- Rank 1
- Range: Extreme
- Duration: Stretch

You can meld your mind with that of a hawk and gain its inhuman sight. You can see the details of anything within Extreme range, everything from horizon to horizon. You see all details and can identify specific people.

### Beastmaster

- Inspiration (Empathy), Survival Instincts (Wits)
- Rank 2
- Range: Short
- Duration: Stretch

You can bend animals, both wild and tame, to your will. The animal can, for example, break off an attack, track down an enemy, run to where you want it to and deliver a message, allow you to ride on it, or even attack your opponents You cannot control an animal with a Strength higher than twice the power level. If you force an animal to act in a way that is outside its normal behavior (like make it perform tricks, for example), or if the animal is agitated, scared, or in combat – the power level needs to be a level 2. Level 3 if both of those situations are in play. You can only control one animal at a time. This spell cannot be used against monsters.

### Bear’s Claw

- Bladework (Strength)
- Rank 2
- Range: Engaged
- Duration: Immediate

You can strike your enemy with the force of a great bear. You hit automatically and cause damage equal to the power level. The attack cannot be parried or dodged, but armor has normal effect.

### Deer’s Dash

- Grace (Agility)
- Rank 2
- Range: Personal
- Duration: Immediate

You can run with the speed of a deer for a short distance. This spell allows you to move (fast action) as an animal with a positive modifier to the Grace roll equal to the power level. Casting this spell does not count as an action in itself. Roll for overcharge/mishap right before you actually move.

### Animal Form

- Endurance (Strength)
- Rank 3
- Range: Personal
- Duration: Immediate

You can shapeshift completely and take the form of an animal. You cannot choose an animal with a Strength higher than twice the power level. You get the Strength and Agility of the animal while you are in animal form. The downside is that you lose your ability to speak and a part of your mental capacity, with the consequence that your Wits and Empathy drop to a D6 each while in animal form. You also get access to the animal’s natural attacks. Shifting back to your normal form requires that you cast the spell again - otherwise you'll shift back after a day.

### Primal Soul

- Inspiration (Empathy)
- Rank 3
- Range: Long
- Duration: Stretch

You can awaken primal emotions in the minds of others. For example, you can bring out the rage of a boar, the laziness of a cat, or the timidity of a sparrow.

- Duration: Round

Controlling the air around you, you create a small whirlwind that propels you into the air. Using the spell, you can fly for one round, moving two zones instead of one per move action.

|2|D8|
|3|D10|
|4|D12|

> [!info] Armor Rating

- Range: Medium
- Duration: Immediate

Forcing air into a spin, you unleash a powerful whirlwind. Your target is pummelled and suffers damage equal to the power level (blunt trauma).

The targets suffer a total amount of damage equal to the power level – you can distribute the damage as you see fit. All victims who take damage are thrown to the ground.

## Symbolism

_The discipline of Symbolism uses runes, esoteric signs and symbols that reflect the underlying patterns of the world. It takes advantage of the forces unleashed by a broad spectrum of laws that are stretched, broken or twisted by the influence of these symbols. The signs of Symbolism can be carved, drawn, or simply formed in the air by the hands of a magic user. In any case, the caster needs at least one free hand. Draw or Carve: Symbolism requires no ingredients apart from the symbols themselves. If they are carved or drawn in any way, the power level is increased by one. Drawing a symbol takes a few minutes and cannot be done in the heat of battle. Carving a symbol into stone takes one Quarter Day or more. The magic user decides when the symbol is activated. Even a drawn or carved symbol only works once._

### Entice

- Rank 1
- Range: Medium
- Duration: Immediate

The symbol lures the victim, who must make an Insight roll with a negative modifier equal to the power level. If the roll fails, the victim must move to within melee range of the symbol, spending all their normal actions to do so. When the victim reaches the symbol, or if the symbol is moved, the effect is broken. No effect on monsters.

### Horrify

- Rank 1
- Range: Medium
- Duration: Immediate

The symbol awakens a deep fear in the victim, who suffers stress (damage to Wits) equal to the power level. No effect on monsters.

### Paralyze

- Rank 1
- Range: Medium
- Duration: Immediate

The hypnotizing power of the symbol mesmerizes your opponent. At power level 1, the victim loses their fast action in the round, or in the next round if they have already used it. At power level 2, they lose their slow action. At power level 3, they lose both actions, and at power level 4, they also lose any bonus actions from talents. The spell has no effect on monsters.

### Blind

- Rank 2
- Range: Medium
- Duration: Quarter Day

The victim must make an Insight roll with a negative modifier equal to the power level. If the roll fails, the symbol blinds the victim. The effect of this blindness is the same as for being in total darkness (page 24). On victims without Wits, such as animals, the effect is automatic, but the spell has no effect on monsters.

### Illusion

- Rank 2
- Range: Medium
- Duration: Stretch

You make the victim see or hear something that isn’t there, or hide something that otherwise would be seen. A small item requires a power level of 1, while an object of humanoid size requires power level 2, and an illusion the size of a house requires power level 3. Only one person is affected. The victim can see through the illusion with an Insight roll, but gets a negative modifier equal to the power level. This spell has no effect on monsters.

### Mind Trick

- Rank 2, Power Word
- Range: Medium
- Duration: Round

You can force an NPC to refrain from an action they would otherwise have performed. It must be a minor action, something you can forget by being absent-minded. An example could be that a guard lets a PC pass without confirming who they are or that someone leaves their keys on a table. The spell cannot be used in combat.

### Puppeteer

- Rank 3
- Range: Short
- Duration: Round

You can take complete control of your victim’s actions. The victim must make an Insight roll with a negative modifier equal to the power level. If the roll fails, the victim becomes a puppet without control of their own body. This control only lasts until the victim’s next ordinary turn, and covers one fast and one slow action. The victim cannot perform reactive actions or bonus actions from talents before the Puppeteer’s actions are performed. The spell has no effect on monsters.

### Power Rune

- Rank 3, Ritual
- Range: Engaged
- Duration: Immediate

You can charge a symbol with power. The symbol must be drawn on or carved into an object, which is then charged with a number of Willpower Points equal to the power level. You can use the symbol later to cast spells, emptying its stored Willpower Points. You don’t need to Bind magic to use this spell. Other magic users skilled in the art of runes can use your Power Runes if they can access them, so keep them to yourself!

### Portal

- Rank 3, Ritual
- Range: Short
- Duration: One Quarter Day per power level

This powerful ritual tears a hole in the veil between worlds and opens a path between them. This is a very risky undertaking, since you run the risk of running into all sorts of demons and other malevolent creatures on the other side – perhaps you can use them for your own purposes, but it is just as likely they will attempt to use you for their own. Or perhaps devour you. The spell Bind Demon (page 35) is very useful here. The details are up to the GM. Another use for this spell is creating a new Portal on the other side, which can lead you anywhere you want.
