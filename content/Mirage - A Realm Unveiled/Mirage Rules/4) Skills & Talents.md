## The Skills

#### Might (Strength)

When something heavy or solid blocks your way and you need to lift, push, or break it, roll for Might. Use this skill for any feat of strength. You may transfer any extra successes to other player characters in the same situation. Might can sometimes be used to repair things, such as a sand skiff with a broken sled. When engaged in hand-to-hand combat, or when attempting to wrestle or grapple the enemy, you use Might. By rolling more successes than required you may:

- Increase your damage by 1. This effect can be chosen multiple times.
- Stress your enemy. Your attack causes mental Conditions rather than physical ones.
- Push the enemy into another zone or a specific part of the zone you are in.
- Make the enemy drop a weapon or item. Picking up an item during combat requires a fast action.
- Grapple your enemy. She must succeed with an opposed roll to break free.

#### Bladework (Strength)

Sometimes, you need to fight for your life, hand-to-hand with your opponent. Roll for this skill when you attack someone or defend yourself using only your body or a melee weapon. Read more about close combat and damage in the next chapter.

When fighting with melee weapons you use Bladework. By rolling more successes than required, you may:

- Increase your damage by 1. This effect can be chosen multiple times.
- Stress your enemy. Your attack causes mental Conditions rather than physical ones.
- Push the enemy into another zone or a specific part of the zone you are in.
- Make the enemy drop a weapon or item. Picking up an item during combat requires a fast action.

#### Endurance (Strength)

When your physical stamina or vigour is tested, roll for Endurance. For example, this skill is used to survive under water or to resist a deadly poison. You also roll Endurance to stay alive when you have suffered a lethal critical injury.

#### Marksmanship (Agility)

Use the Marksmanship skill to fire all types of range weapons. Read more about ranged combat in the next Chapter.

When attacking with ranged weapons or explosives you make a Marksmanship test. By rolling more successes than required you may:

- Increase your damage by 1. This effect can be chosen multiple times.
- Stress your enemy. Your attack causes mental Conditions rather than physical ones.
- Push the enemy into another zone or a specific part of the zone you are in.
- Make the enemy drop a weapon or item. Picking up an item during combat requires a fast action

#### Grace (Agility)

Roll for Grace when you want to perform any action that requires speed or motor control – be it a risky climb, a dangerous jump, or a foot chase after a fleeing enemy. You make an Grace test when attempting to flee, chase someone, jump, or climb. If there are several of you performing the same action you may transfer your successes to others, thus improving their chance to succeed. In combat you can use Grace to evade attacks or escape. Extra successes can be used to:

- Stress your enemy. The enemy gets a mental Condition (may be chosen once per round)
- Move one zone away from the enemy.
- Perform actions while evading the enemy, for instance performing a ritual or setting fire to things in the room.

#### Shadowcraft (Agility)

Roll for Shadowcraft when trying to sneak past someone, staying undetected, or picking someone’s pocket. If your opponent is actively looking for you, it’s an opposed roll against their Observation. If not, it’s just a straight skill roll. Each of the following external factors gives you a +1 modifier to the roll:

- You blend into your surroundings.
- The area is dark or dimly lit.
- The area is crowded or noisy.
- Your opponent is distracted by something.

Each of the following factors gives you a −1 modifier to the roll:

- You stand out against the surroundings.
- There is nothing to hide behind.

#### Culture (Wits)

Culture is a measure of your education, your artistic ability, and your ability to establish connections through logic and knowledge. When you need to know something about what is in front of you, you can make a Culture test to gain clues. Sometimes the GM will say that it requires books or other sources of information. In some situations, it is impossible to get any clues. You can use Culture to translate foreign languages, figure out how best to behave in a certain situation, or understand the workings of a mechanical device, an occult ritual, or a magic item. You can use Culture to obtain basic information about a creature if the Gamemaster deems it appropriate. By rolling more successes than required you can sometimes gain access to more information.

The Culture skill is also used to repair broken gear or building new items, but it can also be used to understand and appraise painting and needlework, operate mechanical constructions, or otherwise understand the depths of all forms of art. Repairing a broken item typically takes a quarter-day of work.

#### Observation (Wits)

The Observation skill can be used to examine an area to find useful information or to spot something or someone from a distance. When the GM calls for it, you can make a passive roll for this skill to detect an approaching threat in time. When examining an area, the GM can give you a positive modifier if your description of where you are searching is very precise, or even let you succeed without a roll.

#### Survival Instincts (Wits)

Roll for Survival Instincts when you’re in a hazardous environment of some kind, be it extreme heat and cold, sandstorms, acid rain, or other forms of extreme weather, and need to figure out a way to stay alive.

#### Healing (Empathy)

In games of Mirage your PC will often risk getting hurt. This is when the Healing skill is useful. It can be used to get a broken character back on their feet or even save their life if they suffered a critical injury.

#### Intuition (Empathy)

This skill represents the ability to read other people and see through lies. Roll for Intuition to assess an NPC’s mood. If you succeed, the GM must reveal the NPC’s current, most powerful emotion – hate, fear, contempt, love, etc. If you roll several successes, you can also determine if an NPC is lying – but not exactly what they are lying about or what the truth is. The Intuition skill can also be used in opposed rolls to resist Inspiration (below).

#### Inspiration (Empathy)

Inspiration is used when attempting to inspire or persuade others. Inspiring usually occurs when speaking to groups of people, or performing. Sometimes, you can make things go your way without resorting to violence. Instead, you trick or convince your opponents without drawing your weapon. For this, you use the Inspiration skill. If your opponent is actively trying to resist you, it’s an opposed roll against their Intuition. If not, it’s a straight roll. Before you roll, you must state the stakes of the roll – what you want to achieve. What you ask of your opponent must be within reason. No NPC will agree to do anything you want or act directly against their own interests, no matter how good your roll is. Conversely, you don’t need to roll for simple requests that your opponent has no reason to resist. The GM has the final say on when Inspiration rolls can or need to be used.

Being Persuaded: Generally, Persuasion is only used against NPCs, not PCs. When NPCs or other PCs try to talk you into something, it’s up to you how you react.

Interrogation: When you interrogate a prisoner to gain information, roll against their Endurance instead of their Intuition. You get a +1 modifier to your roll for your opponent being held captive. As opposed to normal persuasion, interrogation can be used against PCs – actually forcing you to disclose information whether you as a player want to or not.

Persuading a Group: When you want to persuade a whole group, you usually address the group’s leader or spokesperson.

> [!important] Negotiating Position
Your chances of persuading someone using Inspiration are affected by your negotiating position. Each of the following factors gives you +1 modifier to the roll:  
> - Your request doesn’t cost your opponent anything. 
> - Your opponent has suffered damage.  
> - Your opponent is in custody or held captive by you.  
> - You have helped your opponent previously.  
> - You present your case very well (determined by the GM).
>
Each of the following factors gives you a −1 modifier to the roll:  
> - Your opponent must take a serious risk or make a sacrifice to help you. 
> - Your opponent has nothing to gain by helping you.  
> - You are held captive by your opponent.  
> - You are having trouble hearing or understanding each other.

## Talents

While attributes and skills give you the broad strokes of your competency, talents represent specific areas of expertise. Talents are unique tricks and talents that give you an edge and keep your adversaries guessing.  
You typically start the game with just two or a few talents, with your choice limited by your archetype and lineage. You can learn more talents during the game, without being limited by your archetype.

|          Talent           |                                                                                                                                                                           Description                                                                                                                                                                           |

You can start the game by choosing an additional Talent that is tied somehow to your upbringing. Speak to your GM about this. You can replace this Talent (Adaptable) with your chosen Talent.                                                         |

You can make one Fast action before the first round of combat.                                                                        |
| **Peace of the Creator**  | Nurians have a connection to the inner nature of their own, far beyond that of any normal human. When praying, they can choose to enter a state of deep meditation.

The GM has the final say.                                                                                                            |

The following Talents are those that are specific to casting spells. Unlike those found above, each of these are tiered, each with three ranks available. The first time you gain one of these Talents you gain it at Rank 1. Only after achieving rank 1 can you then move to rank 2, and then finally onto rank 3. At each rank you will learn more advanced spells. When noting that you have one of these Talents on your character sheet, be sure to include at what rank. You can learn more about spell casting and disciplines on Chapter 6.
