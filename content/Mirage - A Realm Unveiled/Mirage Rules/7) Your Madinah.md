Your Madinah is home. This is where you have grown up, sheltered from the ever-changing environments of Al-Sarab. Ancient magic has kept the city in a physical stasis, even while the world shifts around you and the community has stayed strong, even venturing out in trade at times. But while the foundations of your city has been solid, the community itself is changing of late, and now a Mirage has descended on you...

## Creating your Madinah

The Madinah, a settlement with usually a few hundred inhabitants, is the starting point of the game. All PCs live in the Madinah and have grown up there. Maybe you've never even left it before! The outside world, Al-Sarab is hard to understand and exceptionally dangerous. Creating your Madinah is the first thing you'll do together after creating your characters together. It’s a simple process – just follow the steps below. As with the rest of the game, there are no wrong answers here. It’s whatever all the players want the game to be.

> [!warning] Tone
> It would be best for you to confer with your fellow players, and the GM, with regards to setting to "tone" of the game prior to building out your Madinah.

## The Region

Before you create the Madinah itself, you need to determine what Region it is in. As a group, start by deciding where in Al-Sarab your Madinah is located. Answer the following questions:

- Our adventure takes place in... (The town is called [Name] and is situated in the [Region] of Al-Sarab)
- The primary biome that the Madinah is located in is.... (You can use the Biome Inspiration table below for help)
- The major rivers or coastlines are...

A short overview of each section can be found below, but more information about each Region can be found in the GM specific parts of this book. Note that this isn't essential information to begin a game of Mirage, though it can help the GM in the future. It can particularly be of use if you're wanting to play through a specific theme, specific biome, or with a specific religion or culture of Al-Sarab. If you're unsure, or it's not particularly important, then we recommend Saraundar.

#### Corallan
[[Corallan]] sits in the northern parts of Al-Sarab. Although predominantly covered in Grasslands, the northern parts of Corallan are well known for her upper reaches of subartic forests and tundra.

Two predominant cultures exist in Corallan, simply known as [[Northern-Coralli]] and [[Southern-Coralli]]. Most in [[Corallan]] worship [[An-Nur]], though the southern parts of the mainland do follow [[Zahrat]] and her followers. 

#### Saraundar
[[Sarundar]] is the most populated, and arguably the most powerful state of Al-Sarab. Known for her vast deserts, her people are strong-willed and hard-working. Culturally [[Dari]], they worship [[Al-Khaliq]] as the one creator God. 

#### Valouros
[[Valouros]] is by far the most varied state in Al-Sarab, home to jungles, snow-covered mountains as well as deserts. 

Culturally, many that call this part of the world are [[Dari]], though the southern parts of [[Valouros]] is home to the [[Endari]], well known as the [[Second Worshippers]]. Recently, those that moved onto the higher parts of [[Valouos]] have also taken up worshipping [[Zahrat]] - possibly looking to, or inspired by those in [[Zepheria]].

#### Zepheria
[[Zepheria]] is well known for its mountainous region, and the people that live a life on the mountain peaks. Although most of the region is culturally [[Dari]], those that live on the mountains are [[Zephari]], and take pride in their cultural distinctiveness. This cultural difference extends to religious beliefs as well, with the [[Zephari]] worshiping [[Zahrat]] and her followers. It is thought by scholars that worship of [[Zahrat]] originated here. 

## The Madinah

Once your Region and primary biome has been decided upon, it’s time to look closer at the Madinah itself. We want to encourage you to put in as much effort into this as is fun for you - but note that the more you do here, the better your adventures will be!

### Type of Madinah
The first thing you need to decide is what kind of city your Madinah is. Here are some examples, but feel free to choose for yourself:

- Desert Oasis
- Mountain Refuge
- Hidden Valley
- Waterfall Haven
- First Worshippers' Runes
- Subterranean Cavern
- Ancient Observatory
- Floating Island
- Underground Bunker
- Scrap Village
- Small Island
- Rolling Famelands

Discuss in the group and agree on something you all like. If you get stuck, there are 12 examples, you could always roll a D12 and let the dice decide!

### Madinah Details
Once you know what sort of madinah you're playing in, players take turns answering the following questions to fill in the major details, adapting the number of questions asked as indicated below so that each player is answering the same number of questions about the town.

- Most of the people in our madinah consider part-jinn to be... (describe the general outlook on part-jinn, particularly the more common majidjin - are they wary, kind, adversarial, open, in awe etc.?)
- An industry or art form our town is best known for is…
- Our madinah is famous for…
- Our madinah is infamous for...
- Economically, our madinah is… (e.g., prospering, floundering, starting to stagnate) and one effect of that is...
- The madinah closest to us is named… and our relationship with that madinah is…(e.g., amicably competitive, resentful, economically envious, compassionately helpful). — Answer as a group with as much discussion as you need.
- A notable local organisation is… *Duplicate in a five-player game.*
- A notable local landmark is… *Duplicate in a three-player game or five-player game*.

### Madinah Rumours
After constructing the village, town, or city, each of you shares one rumour that's currently circulating within the madinah. Especially in small towns, rumours drive a lot of what goes on, but even in something the size of a small city there are still plenty of ways that news gets around. These can be mundane or supernatural, big or small, personal or about the entire town, generally believed or completely fringe… anything you want. The GM writes these rumours down, keeping them in mind so that they can influence the upcoming games, though there may be sources for the rumour that the players can’t even imagine. As long as you’re within the bounds of what the group has agreed to include in the game, there are no wrong answers. Also, not all rumours have to have any amount of truth to them...

Here are some examples:

- **Whispers of a Hidden Bazaar:** There are murmurs of a mystical bazaar that materialises only during the light of a crescent moon. Traders peddle rare artefacts and magical trinkets that can only be found within its mysterious confines.
- **The Enigmatic Alchemist's Elixir:** The local alchemist is said to have concocted a potion rumoured to unveil glimpses of the future. Some believe it grants prophetic visions, while others dismiss it as mere wishful thinking.
- **Dancing Lights in the Desert:** Travellers speak of ethereal lights that dance across the desert sands at night. Locals attribute it to benevolent spirits, while others fear it may be an omen of impending danger.
- **The Silent Guardian of the Oasis:** A guardian, resembling a shimmering warrior, is said to watch over a hidden oasis. It is believed that those with pure intentions may receive guidance, but approaching with malice invites the guardian's wrath.
- **The Cursed Statues of the Grand Plaza:** Whispers circulate about statues in the Grand Plaza that are said to come to life at the stroke of midnight. Some claim these animated figures offer cryptic advice, while others warn of a dark curse.
- **Ephemeral Music on High:** Travellers report hearing enchanting melodies echoing from the peaks of the nearby Mountains. Legend has it that those who follow the music may discover a celestial sanctuary.
- **The Phantom Caravan:** Nomads speak of a phantom caravan that traverses the desert at incredible speeds. It is said to carry treasures from distant lands, and those who witness it may be granted a boon or a curse.
- **The Oracle's Veiled Prophecy:** An enigmatic oracle is said to reside in a concealed chamber beneath the city. Seekers claim that the oracle imparts cryptic prophecies, but gaining access to her presence requires solving an intricate riddle.

## A Mirage Unravels

During the creation of your Region, you'll have decided on the primary biome your Madinah is located in. Although Al-Sarab is well known for it's ever-changing nature, these changes happen on the scale of decades. With one exception - that of Mirages. These mirages are magical phenomena that create unique and strange landscapes in the space of hours, or even minutes. For example, they might be lush vegetation, and sparkling water sources in the midst of the shifting desert, or hot sand dunes and dry canyons within a humid jungle. Recently, a roving Mirage has unravelled in the local area and it is not possible to predict just how long the Mirage will be around for.

> [!info] The nature of an anchor
> A madinah's anchor protects the area from the change-magic of Al-Sarab. But the environment outside this protective shield is very much visible from the inside of the protective magic. If a madinah is located inside a desert, and a rogue mirage turns the outside area into a jungle, the denizens of the madiah can see the jungle. 

The magical nature of Mirages often attract the attention of nomadic tribes, adventurers, or mystical creatures, so beware, you are unlikely to be alone for very long. But exploring them will often come with immense boons as they may provide various benefits when discovered, including rare resources, unique encounters, or clues leading to hidden treasures.

Regardless, within your Madinah, your primary biome(s) reigns supreme, if you're located high on a mountain, it's still snowing in your Madinah, if you're in a jungle, vines still cover the homes. The Madinah is protected by it's anchor, and very little will disrupt this effect. Needless to say, though, given the entire area around the Madinah is now in constant flux, your settlement might need to make some changes in order to survive, or maybe it's even time to consider a permanent move?

To finalise the Madinah creation process, roll or let the GM choose on the Biome Inspiration table below to determine the nature of the Mirage surrounding your Madinah.

At the beginning of each session, the GM rolls a D12 and consults the Shifting Mirage table below to determine what, if anything, has changed with regard to this Mirage. They can reroll if you've rolled the same effect recently or if for some reason the effect wouldn't be possible.

| 11  | Something has happened to your anchor and it fails for long enough for the Mirage to change the biome of the Madinah itself. Roll on the Biome Inspiration table - the environment within the Madinah, and out in the region, is now the same. If the anchor broke, once it is repaired it "locks in" whatever environment reigns at that time. Otherwise, if it was a momentary failing, then the anchor returns to normalcy soon after the shift and "locks in" whatever environment reigns at that time. |
