Your player character (PC) is your most important asset in any Mirage game. They are your avatar, your eyes and ears in the world. But they, in return, depend on you making the right decisions for them. Take your PC seriously and play them as if they were a real person. It’s more fun that way. At the same time, don’t try to protect your PC from every conceivable danger. The goal of the game is to create a good story. For that to happen you need to take risks. During the course of the game, your PC will change and develop. Their skills and talents can be developed through experience, but you can also discover how their personality changes and is formed in a way that cannot be measured by numbers on a page. This is when your player character truly comes alive.

> [!important] Seven Steps of Creation
How you create your player character is explained in detail in this chapter. The summary below is a helpful overview. Grab a character sheet, a pencil, and follow these steps:
> 1. Choose your lineage
> 2. Choose your archetype.
> 3. Determine your attributes.
> 4. Determine your Resolve
> 5. Determine your Skills.
> 6. Choose your starting talents.
> 7. Work on your relationships.
> 8. Determine your personality traits.
> 9. Determine your resources and equipment.
> 10. Choose a name.

### Lineages

Many diverse beings inhabit the mystical realms of Al-Sarab, ranging from ordinary humans to legendary abominations. Within this tapestry of existence, there are different lineages you can choose between for your player character. Most people in Al-Sarab are human, and although family history will play a part in their social standing, they are commonly believed to be created equal in the eyes of Al-Khaliq. Occasionally, though, ancient bloodlines may appear again, resulting in part-jinn humans that clearly show features that have come from behind the veil. These people are very uncommon, and their standing shifts from settlement to settlement. Most people who die of old age in Al-Sarab will do so somewhere between 80-90 years of age. Part-jinn usually die somewhere around 110-120.

The more numerous are the Majidjin. Majidjin features vary, but many will have metallic eyes, runes etched into the skin on their arms, pointed ears, or tattoos that shift over the course of their lives.

In contrast, the Nurian and Anukari stand as exceedingly rare figures, capturing attention wherever they tread. Nurians will often have feathers that grow on their head and down their necks in place of hair, the colour of which can vary greatly - from pitch black to a copper that shines in the sun. Anukari in particular will often not be welcomed in "normal" society. Those with Anukari lineage often hope for nothing more than prominent canine teeth, but most are born with jackal-like features from the waist up, including a canid head and longer more powerful arms.

While humans represent the most widespread lineage, your choices remain unrestricted. Each lineage possesses a brief description further in this chapter. Although your choice does not influence your attributes, each lineage offers a unique talent exclusive to itself. Typical archetypes associated with each lineage are suggested, yet you are by no means obligated to adhere strictly to these classifications. In the vast expanse of Al-Sarab, there always exist extraordinary individuals charting unconventional paths through life.

### Archetypes

The next step is to select an archetype for your character. The archetype determines what type of person you are, your background and role in the group. Your archetype will influence your attributes, skills, talents, and starting gear.

Archetypes can feel stereotypical, but they are meant to be. Picking an archetype is a quick way for yourself and the other players to get an immediate feel for your character. But remember that your character is more than just their archetype. The archetype is just a starting point toward creating a unique player character. You can find all Archetypes described later in this chapter.

### Attributes

Your character has four attributes that indicate your basic physical and mental capabilities. Your attributes are used when you roll dice to perform actions in the game, and also determine how much damage and stress you can withstand before you become broken. Read more about this in Chapter 4.

- **STRENGTH**: Raw muscle power and brawn
- **AGILITY**: Body control, speed, and motor skills
- **WITS**: Sensory perception, intelligence, and sanity
- **EMPATHY**: Personal charisma and ability to manipulate others

**Starting Scores:** You start with a baseline of a D8 in all four attributes. You may then make three increases, of one step each, up to a D12. You can increase any attributes you want. You can gain one extra increase by decreasing one attribute from a D8 to a D6.

Archetypes have a "Primary Attribute" - this is a recommendation if you're not sure what your higher attribute should be, you need not follow it if you'd prefer.

|Die Type|Die Size|Description|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|D12|12|Extraordinary|
|D10|10|Capable|
|D8|8|Average|
|D6|6|Feeble|
### Skills

Your skills are the knowledge and abilities you have acquired during your life. They are important, as they determine, along with your attributes, how effectively you can perform certain actions in the game. There are twelve basic skills in Mirage - a list can be found below, and they are detailed in the next chapter.

Skill levels are measured on a scale from no dice, to D6 to D12. Just like for attributes, each skill level is connected to a specific die type. See the table below.

> [!info] Skills
Might (Strength)  
Bladework (Strength)  
Endurance (Strength)  
Marksmanship (Agility)  
Grace (Agility)  
Shadowcraft (Agility)  
Artistry (Wits)  
Observation (Wits)  
Survival Instincts (Wits)  
Healing (Empathy)  
Intuition (Empathy)  
Inspiration (Empathy)

**No Skill Level?** You can generally roll for a skill even if you have no level at all in that skill – in that case, only use the associated attribute for the skill in question.

**Starting Skills:** Choose one D10 level skill, two D8 level skills, and three D6 level skills. Your D10 level skill must be one listed by your archetype. You can choose your D8 and D6 level skills freely.

|Die Type|Description|
|:-:|:-:|
|D12|Elite|
|D10|Veteran|
|D8|Experienced|
|D6|Novice|

### Talents

Talents are tricks, traits, and abilities that can benefit you in various situations. They affect your die rolls, or give you access to powers or resources. Talents are described in the next chapter. Your archetype offers three starting talents to choose from when creating your player character. As you play and gain experience points (addressed below) you can get more talents. You may then choose freely among them, including talents from other archetypes.

### Relationships

In games of Mirage, every player PC knows each other by default. If you have a strong desire to create a character that doesn't know some or all of the other members of your group, checking with your GM is needed as it will influence the following character creation section. Whether you've taken this route or not, complete the below steps for all characters that you know.

First of all, you need to decide on how you know the other PCs. To do this, the player to the right of the GM introduces their character first, then, a player who believes that they have a relationship to that character should introduce their own character, explaining how they know the previous character. This is a good time to start talking as your character: “We know each other from when we worked on the same trading caravan” rather than “My character knew their character for a few months.” Subsequent players should then introduce their character either by tying into the latest character or any introduced before. It’s fine if one of the characters is the only connection for the others.

Now that you've got the basic idea of how you're connected, it's time to dive a bit deeper. One by one, each of you will answer a set of questions about the other characters, using the Relationship Questions found below. Each player character answers one positive, and one negative question for each of the other PCs. If you need to start a game quickly, you can answer the two questions for just one other PC, but we highly recommend putting in the time to solidify your character relationships - this process will add significant depth to your stories, setting the stage for the unfolding mysteries ahead.

### Personality Traits

The Mirage games use a variety of methods to give your PC unique personality traits beyond the numerical stats. After any session, you may also change these personality traits. Try to connect the change to something that has happened during the course of the game or connect them to the relationships you completed above.

**Pride**: Something specific that defines your character and makes them stand out. It can be an ability, an event in your past, or something else. Once per game session, you may check your Pride to get one automatic success in a dice roll. You must justify how your Pride helps you.

**Shame**: Something that you have experienced before the game begins that has left its mark on you or still threatens you in some way. Your Shame is primarily a tool for the GM to create stories with, but can also earn you extra XP you get after a game session.

**Relationships**: Your relationship with each of the other PCs, described with a short sentence for each. Your relationships are mainly used by the GM to create interesting challenges for you in the game.

**Confidant**: The PC in the group that you feel closest to. Making a sacrifice or taking a big risk for your Confidant will earn you extra XP.

> [!info] Personality Traits after the first Chapter
> Some groups prefer to fill out the personality traits after a few sessions of play - after they get a feel for their character. Feel free to do this! Whether you fill this out at the end of your first or second session, or whether you do it in the prologue, just be sure to fill these out *after* going through the Relationships step.

### Resources

In Al-Sarab, there are a few ways that "currency" is used. For most of the world, the use of glass disks is common, though in some places small bolts of fabric is also used. In games of Mirage, you will not need to track each disk of glass though. Instead, you'll use "Resources".

Your Resources value indicates how much capital you have at your disposal. A higher value means that you enjoy a nicer home and lifestyle, and have easier access to things you need. The table below shows the meaning of different values. In-game events that affect your living standard will change the value. Normally your Archetype will determine your Resources. Once you start playing you can increase Resources by purchasing the Wealthy talent (see chapter 4).

### Resources

|Value|Standard of Living|
|:-:|:-:|
|1|**Destitute**. You are completely dependent on others for your survival. Every day is a struggle for food and you have few, if any, belongings. This may have caused you to contract diseases, starve, or turn to drugs or alcohol for relief.|
|2|**Poor**. You live very simply. Most days there is food on the table, but far too little. If you have children, they are forced to live in squalor. You might own a change of clothes and a few possessions. Loss of income would be disastrous for you and your family.|
|3|**Struggling**. You have a humble home and a fixed income. You have no money for savings, but you can dress your family for special occasions and your children have some access to education – at least for a few years.|
|4|**Financially Stable**. You own your own home and have a job that provides a steady income. Most likely you have some money stashed away. Occasionally you may treat yourself to some sweets, a trip, or a beautiful object. In times of crisis there are people to lend you money.|
|5|**Middle-class**. You own a home and maybe a business. You may even have one or several employees and know how to invest for the future. You have savings and access to loans. You and your family are living well.|
|6|**Well-off**. You have a big house or apartment. You probably have multiple sources of income and several employees. You do not think of money as a scarce resource, but as a game to increase your capital and influence. You keep fine company and have little contact with the poor. Your family can go on trips and you can afford all the latest innovations.|
|7|**Wealthy**. You have large amounts of inherited money and real estate. You probably own multiple properties, keep lots of servants, and have many sources of income. There are few things you cannot afford. You are well-connected with the city’s and country’s elite, and on good terms with senior officials, politicians, and nobles. The only time you see any poor people is through your carriage window.|
|8|**Filthy Rich**. You are one of the richest people in the country and have direct contact with its rulers. You own one or several castles or mansions. There is no expense too great. You can treat yourself to lavish extravagance without ever worrying about the cost.|

### Gear & Equipment

Your archetype typically determines what gear you can choose from at the start of the game. The weight and amount of gear is not usually tracked in games of Mirage, but you can speak to your GM to confirm this if so desired. You will acquire more gear and treasure as you play the game, so be sure to keep track of what you find, steal, or buy, as you never know what mysteries or challenges it will help you solve!

### Experience

The things you learn during the game are measured in Experience Points (XP). You receive XP after the end of each game session. Talk it through and let the whole group discuss what has happened. For each of the below questions that you can reply “yes” to, you get one XP:

- Did you participate in the game session?
- Did you explore a new location?
- Did you defeat one or more dangerous adversaries?
- Did you overcome an obstacle without using force?
- Did you act according to your pride/shame/relationships?
- Did you act in accordance with your values and beliefs when difficult?

The GM has the final word when it comes to how much XP each character should get.

#### Spending XP

You can use your XP to improve your skills and talents, or to learn new ones. You can only spend XP when your PC gets a chance to rest, or between game sessions.

**Skills:** To increase a skill level by one step costs a number of XP indicated in the table below. You can only increase a skill level one step at a time. Learning a new skill (at skill level D6) costs 5 XP.

In addition, to raise a skill level or gain a new skill, you must have used the skill and succeeded at least once since your last increase. Make a mark by the skill on the character sheet to indicate this. Only meaningful skill rolls where something is truly at stake count for this purpose. The GM has final say. As an alternative to making a skill roll, you can be instructed for one quarter-day by a teacher with a higher skill level than you.

|Target Level|XP Cost|
|:-:|:-:|
|D6|5|
|D8|10|
|D10|15|
|D12|20|

**Talents:** Learning a talent costs 10 XP, but also requires a teacher – a PC or NPC who already knows the specialty – instructing you for at least one quarter-day. After the quarter-day, the teacher makes a Persuasion roll. If they fail, you learn nothing this quarter-day. You keep your XP and the teacher can try again in another quarter-day. The exception to this is learning a magic discipline, or increasing the Talent rank in a magical discipline you already know (see Chapter 6 for more details).

> [!info] Reminder: Quarter-days
There are four quarter-days in a day: morning, day, evening, and night.

### Develop your Madinah

The final development in setting up your game does not happen to your character, but to the entire town - called the Madinah - itself. After creating your Characters, turn to Chapter 7, here you'll develop your Madinah alongside the other players.
