This chapter delves into conflict, those moments where dialogue yields no resolution, and actions speak louder than words. Conflict is very deadly in Mirage. Be sure to ask yourself, is it worth it? The first part of the chapter unveils combat rules, going over turn order, what actions characters can perform, and various circumstances that may affect your chances of success. It covers movement mechanics, creating ambushes, chasing or evading, and grappling techniques. Next, guidelines for physical injuries and their ramifications are detailed, followed by insights into psychological scars borne from harrowing ordeals. The rules describe how to make Fear tests to avoid being affected by what is happening before your eyes. Finally, methods for healing are covered, as well as sections for armour, equipment, and weapons.

# Combat

Combat begins when you or someone else attempts to shoot, hit, or otherwise harm someone.

## Rounds & Initiative

Combat is played out in rounds, each roughly 5–10 seconds long, split into two Turns. During each round everyone takes turns performing actions. When everyone is done, the round is over and another one begins. When combat begins, the first step is to determine who has the initiative. Do this before anyone rolls dice for an action.

### Group Initiative

There are only two Turns per Round, the player's turn and then the adversary's turn. Starting with the player's turn, they go back and forth until combat has concluded.

> [!warning] Interruptions
Players should note that enemies have the same action options as they do. Some actions will give your opponent the opportunity to perform a reactive action that breaks the turn order. Actions that occur in the other party's turn are called interruptions. Interruptions are a frequent part of combat in Mirage!

### Surprise

If either party initiates combat with an attack that the GM deems completely surprising, they can take a full turn before standard combat begins. This means that if the party initiates a surprise, they will have two full turns before the adversary's turn. If the party is taken by surprise, then the adversaries gain a full turn, and then standard combat ensues. Also see Ambushes.

Individuals within a party can also surprise an enemy (like a sneak attack, see below). If this occurs, only those who initiated the surprise can act before normal combat ensues.

### Standoffs

Combat is deadly, _very_ deadly. Even if one doesn't lose their life, the social blow-back received if others deem them dishonourable can be crippling. For most people who call Al-Sarab home, combat is the last resort - understanding that there is often no turning back once blood has been spilt. Because of this, it isn't uncommon for adversaries to find themselves in a standoff, an environment where each seeks violence but is unwilling to make the first move and be found dishonourable given an unfortunate end. In a standoff, all members of the party roll on Grace. Anyone in the party who rolls a success can all take a turn together first. Then the adversaries take their turn, and then standard combat ensues.

> [!info] No one acts
You can use the standoff rules whenever there is a situation where neither side of a conflict is willing to act first.

## Maps & Zones

The scene where combat takes place is divided into zones. A zone is typically a room, a corridor, or an area of ground. How big a zone is varies – from a few steps across up to about 25 meters. Usually it is an open space delimited by walls, stairs, a river or other similar features. A zone is generally smaller in a cramped environment than in open terrain. When combat begins the GM can draw a map of the area and mark each zone. The GM can also mark places where it is possible to take cover. Some obstacles can only be moved through, over or around by performing an action or passing a skill test. For example, it might take a successful **Might** test and a slow action to clear a pile of rubble blocking an exit.

**Playing without maps:** Although maps can be useful, you can always choose not to use them and let certain conflicts play out only in the “theatre of the mind.” This can be a good solution in close quarters conflicts between a small number of combatants.

> [!faq] Zone Features and other Circumstances
Zones can have various features, which affect actions performed within them. Here are some examples:
> - **Cluttered:** The zone is covered by dense undergrowth or filled with debris of some sort. You must roll for Grace when you move into the zone. Failure means you manage to get into the zone, but you fall down.
> - **Dimly Lit:** The zone is dimly lit. Observation rolls in the zone get a −1 modifier. Ranged attacks into the zone also suffer a −1 modifier, and can’t pass through the zone.
> - **Cramped:** A crawlspace or narrow tunnel. In a cramped zone, you can only crawl, not run. You also cannot move or shoot past individuals next to you against targets behind them.

### Range Categories

|Range|Description|
|:-:|:-:|
|Personal|Yourself|
|Engaged|Right next to you|
|Short|A few meters away, in the same zone as you|
|Medium|Up to 25 meters away, in an adjacent zone|
|Long|Up to about one hundred meters (four zones) away|
|Extreme|Up to about one kilometre|

## Slow & Fast Actions

Player Characters, animals, and most other Non-Player Characters can perform two actions per turn, one slow and one fast. During the player's turn, each player can perform one slow action and one fast action, or two fast actions. See the lists of typical slow and fast actions below.

Fast actions are quick and rarely require a test to succeed; you might shout a word or two, or draw your weapon. Some fast actions can also be used as interruptions – an action that breaks the turn order due to the fact that interruptions may be performed at any time during the round. This means that you can hold off on performing a fast action until after the player's turn to be ready for an enemy’s attacks. When using interruptions to protect yourself, you must choose to spend your action before you know whether your opponent’s attack roll fails or succeeds. Actions "saved" in this manner do not carry over to

**Free Actions**: Dropping to the ground or shouting a few words are called free actions – they don’t count toward your two actions for the round, but you can only do them on your own turn.

### Slow Actions

|Action|Skill|
|:-:|:-:|
|Attack with melee weapon|Bladework|
|Shoot ranged weapon|Marksmanship|
|Unarmed attack|Might|
|Wrestle, push, grapple|Might|
|Treat injuries and other kinds of first aid|Healing|
|Persuade|Inspiration|
|Cast a spell|Varies|
|Survey the situation|Observation|
|Climb a wall|Grace|

### Fast Actions

|Fast Action|Skill|
|:-:|:-:|

|Assume Overwatch position|-|

### Describe Your Actions

When you want to act, simply state which actions you wish to perform and roll dice if needed to see if you are successful.

> [!faq] Mark Your Actions
Because players can act in any order and interruptions occur out of turn, it can sometimes be hard to keep track of how many actions the combatants have performed. A tip is to keep track of this by using tokens or cards. Two types of card or token (one for fast actions, one for slow actions) is even better. All actions are refreshed at the start of each round.

### Helping Others

If you wish to help another player character or NPC perform an action, it costs you one action of the same kind (slow or fast). You must state you are trying to help someone before any dice are rolled.

## Movement

You can use a fast action to position yourself any- where within your zone. If the enemy is hiding behind cover or located far away in the zone, you may have to spend a fast action to get close enough to make a Bladework attack. Entering an adjacent zone also requires a fast action. No roll is required to move, unless something (like a cluttered space) makes it difficult.

## Ambushes & Sneak Attacks

One, particularly useful, way to win a conflict is to attack when your enemy least expects it. You can achieve this in several different ways.

**Sneak Attack:** When you sneak up on someone undetected and perform an attack, it is called a sneak attack. First you make a Shadowcraft roll. Moving close enough to attack in melee combat (within melee range) gives you a −2 modifier. If you fail, the enemy notices you and combat ensues.  
If you succeed, your attack counts as surprising, which means that you will act before normal combat ensues. For Bladework or ranged sneak attacks, you also get a +2 modifier, and the target cannot block or dodge the attack. Sneak attacks are always performed individually, by one attacker against one target.

**Ambush:** A special kind of sneak attack is an ambush – lying in wait for an enemy and attacking as it passes by. In this case each victim makes an Observation roll to spot the ambush, with a −2 modifier if the attackers are well prepared. All those that fail skip their first turn of combat.

## Bladework

Attacking an enemy requires a skill test. Unarmed attacks are performed with Might. When armed with melee weapons you use Bladework. For ranged attacks you use Marksmanship.

You need one success to hit your target, dealing damage as indicated on the Weapons table. The damage value shown is the number of physical Conditions that afflict the enemy as a result of your attack. When rolling multiple successes you can choose to deal additional damage (for more on using extra successes in combat, see the skills in chapter 4). For each success the opponent suffers another Condition. There can be no barrier between you and your target. If there is, you must first cross the barrier. Cover has no effect against Bladework attacks.

Human NPCs and animals often don’t suffer Conditions, but have a Toughness value instead. This works in a similar way. For instance, an NPC who is hit for 3 damage loses 3 Toughness points and gets a -3 modifier on the next test (see Non-Player Characters in chapter 8).

## Dodging & Blocking

When attacked, you can use your fast action to block an attack in Bladework, or dodge a ranged attack. Both of these are interruptions you can use at any time during the round, even if it is not your turn. This means that you can choose to “save” your fast action in case you need to block later in the round. You dodge or block by passing a skill test. You use Grace to dodge, and Might or Bladework to block depending on whether or not you are armed. Each success deducts one success from the enemy’s attack. If you deduct all the enemy’s successes, the attack misses. You must choose to dodge or block before you know whether the enemy has succeeded with her attack.

## Holding & Wrestling

When attempting to wrestle or grapple your opponent, you make a Might test. Your opponent can use an interruption to break free, also using Might. If you succeed, she is restrained and cannot perform any actions other than breaking free or shouting. Preventing your opponent from speaking by putting your hand over her mouth requires an extra success. The opponent is restrained until you let her go or she breaks free. Once per turn she may use a fast action to try and break free. You can use hold as an interruption. The two of you then make an opposed roll for Might. The person being held must get more successes than her opponent in order to break free; if you get the same number of successes the situation remains unchanged. If you do not use an interruption to hold her, she only requires a single success to break free. The person being held can block, but cannot attack or flee until she manages to break free.

## Marksmanship

To attack someone with a hand-held ranged weapon, roll for Marksmanship, except for thrown weapons, which use Grace. To draw a weapon is a fast action, while firing a weapon is a slow action. The Weapons table shows the range of ranged weapons. The value indicates how many zones your weapon can reach from where you are standing. A zero means that you can only use that weapon against enemies in the same zone, whereas a one or more means it possible to attack enemies in adjacent zones.

> [!example] For Example
A spear with range 0-1 can be used in the same zone as your enemy or one zone away. A longbow with range 1-3 can be used against enemies one, two, or three zones away from you, but not against those in the same zone.

**Target Size:** Firing at a large target, such as a huge creature, gives a +2 modifier to the attack. Firing at a small object, such a hatch or a hand-held item, gives a −2 modifier.

**Unseen Target:** If you can’t see your target (because of darkness or cover) but still have a good idea of where they are, you can still fire, but with a −2 modifier.

> [!info] Ammunition
You are expected to carry enough ammunition to use your weapon. In combat you have time to reload between actions. In certain situations the GM may ask you to keep track of how many arrows you have left – perhaps you are trapped in a network of caves and must preserve your resources.

### Overwatch

As a fast action, you can assume an overwatch position in a specified direction, as long as you have a ranged weapon and no enemies next to you within melee range. This means that you aim in the specified direction and are ready to shoot. Between the time you assume the overwatch position and your time to act in the next round, you can fire your weapon against a target in the chosen direction. You can fire whenever you want in either your own, or the enemy's, turn. Your shot is resolved before all other actions – even if they are already declared. For example, if an enemy in the direction you are aiming attempts to fire a weapon, you can shoot first. The enemy is not allowed to change their attack after your overwatch attack.

Firing when in overwatch position counts as a normal attack (a slow action). Therefore, you must save your slow action in the round for any overwatch attack you want to make. If both you and an enemy assume overwatch positions against each other, and both choose to fire against each other, then an opposed Marksmanship roll determines which attack goes first. This roll does not count as an action for either of you.

**Losing Overwatch:** You keep your overwatch position until you break it, or any of the following occurs:

- You perform any action other than overwatch fire.
- You are attacked in Bladework.
- You suffer damage

## Fleeing & Chasing

You use Grace to flee combat. A successful skill test means that you leave the fight; if you fail, you remain in the same zone. You cannot flee if doing so would require you to move through a zone occupied by an enemy (this does not include the zone the character starts her turn in).

An opponent standing in the same zone as you can try to prevent you from fleeing. She uses an interruption to chase and then makes an Grace test. Each of her successes deducts one success from your result. If she manages to deduct all your successes, you stay in the fight. Both of you have moved one zone in the direction you were fleeing.

## Cover

When enemies are shooting at you, hunkering down behind cover – preferably something solid – can save your life. Taking cover in the zone you’re in counts as a fast action. Cover has an armour rating and works exactly like armour – but only against ranged attacks. Cover can be degraded just like armour. Cover can be combined with armour – roll for cover first, then armour.

|Barrier|Armor Rating|
|:-:|:-:|
|Furniture|D6|
|Wooden Door|D8|
|Tree Trunk|D8|
|Wooden Wall|D10|
|Stone Wall|D12|

# Damage & Injuries

You can suffer "damage" in many ways in Mirage, and they result in Conditions. Conditions are described in Chapter 3. The type of damage (mental or physical) determines the type of Condition that afflicts you. In combat, the weapon’s damage value indicates how many Conditions you get.

### Unanswered Prayer

How unanswered prayer rolls can inflict Conditions is described in Chapter 3. Armour has no effect against damage from unanswered prayer.

## Broken

In Mirage, your PC can be broken by Conditions. When you already have three Conditions of the same type and acquire a fourth one, you become Broken. Being Broken means that you are seriously injured, temporarily insane, or otherwise worn down. You may not perform any actions, physical or mental. Immediately roll on one of the Critical Injuries tables below. You and the GM together decide exactly what happens to your character, depending on what caused you to become Broken.

### Broken by a Physical Injury

If you become Broken due to a physical injury, it can mean that you have passed out, are bleeding heavily, have broken several bones, or that you experience such severe pain that you lose control of your body. You automatically fail all tests. The only actions you can perform are talking succinctly and, if the GM allows it, crawling to safety. Each attack that hits you while Broken causes another critical injury

### Broken by a Mental Injury

Being Broken as a result of acquiring mental Conditions means that you are overwhelmed by the situation you are in – perhaps you are suffering from delusions or have lost all hope of survival, or maybe you no longer know who or where you are. In any case, you have lost the ability to look after yourself and act with purpose. If attacked while Broken by mental Conditions, you can flee, parry, and dodge, making skill tests as usual to see if you succeed. You cannot attack enemies or perform rituals, but are otherwise able to use your body and move around. You are still able speak, although what you say may not be coherent.

## Critical Injuries

Critical injuries are dangerous, even lethal, injuries to your body or mind. You suffer a physical critical injury when you are broken by physical conditions, and a mental critical injury when you are broken by mental conditions.

> [!info] Damage through Unanswered Prayer
There is one case where you don’t risk any critical injury when broken: when your prayer isn't answered to such an extent that you break yourself. This is very rare, but it can happen. This means you can never kill yourself due to unanswered prayer.

When you become Broken, immediately roll on the table for either Physical or Mental Critical Injuries. Roll a D66, that is two six-sided dice, after deciding which die represents the tens and which represents the ones. For example, if you roll a three on the first die and a six on the other, the result is 36. The tables below show what kind of injury you get.

There is a fatal column for physical injuries, and a chronic column for mental ones. This means that some critical injuries must be treated by someone else (see Treating Critical Injuries later in this chapter) within a certain time limit – or else you will die or remain mentally broken forever. Should that happen, you discard your player character and create a new one.

Even if you receive treatment and cease to be Broken, the injury will affect you for the near future - the GM will decide if or when it wares off. The Critical Injuries table states whether you have acquired a Defect or an Insight. Defects are things that affect you negatively, such as impaired vision in one eye or a general sense of dread that refuses to let up. Insights are superhuman abilities that help you, for example by giving you visions of the future or infusing you with power that makes it easier for you to pass a certain skill test.

The GM will decide when you must determine whether your Defects and Insights become permanent, or whether they heal or pass. This will usually be when an adventure comes to a close, or significant time passes. Rules for this can be found later in this chapter.

# Fear

When encountering jinn, being exposed to magic, or feeling scared or stressed as a result of seeing something horrible like dead bodies, it takes effort not to lose control and become Terrified. You must pass a Fear test. 

Choose whether to tackle the situation with Wits or Empathy. The attribute value indicates what type of dice you will roll. You gain a modifier equal to the number of player characters present (maximum of a +3 modifier). Player characters who are Broken or already Terrified do not count. If you become frightened during combat you use the number of player characters situated in the same zone as you. 

Mental Conditions sometimes add penalties to Fear tests. On failure you can pray. Some talents make Fear tests easier to pass. The Fear value of the creature, magic, or occurrence indicates how many successes you need. If successful, you manage to control your emotions and can act normally. Extra successes have no effect. On failure you become Terrified. 

Roll a six-sided die to see how many rounds it takes to regain control of yourself. Whether you flee, freeze, faint, or attack is up to you (see the Terrified section below). Once you have regained control you are no longer Terrified. 

Lastly, it should be noted that if you become Terrified in a situation that isn’t particularly hazardous, where the duration of the effect or your exact reaction is irrelevant, the Gamemaster can let you improvise your reaction and how long it lasts – for example if you are examining a mutilated corpse in an otherwise secure location

> [!info] Terrified
> When Terrified you can choose either to: 
> - Flee: You must use all your actions to flee from the thing that frightens you. There is no time to pick things up, talk, or help someone else. You choose the nearest and fastest way out of there.
> - Freeze: Your body refuses to move, rendering you completely immobile. You cannot talk or perform any actions whatsoever. If you are in a dark or concealed position, it takes a successful Observation test to spot you. 
> - Faint: Your body goes limp, and a veil of darkness descends over the world. If you are lying in a dark or concealed position, it takes a successful Observation test to spot you. 
> - Attack: You attack the nearest hostile person or creature with whatever weapon you are currently holding. You lose the ability to make strategic choices, and will not stop attacking until the enemy is vanquished. You cannot perform any fast actions. If there are no enemies nearby, you explode in a fit of rage and start breaking things around you

## Fear Value Table
| Situation | Fear Value |
| ---- | ---- |
| Scary - a jinn, a bloody corpse | 1 |
| Terrible - a dangerous mythical creature, dead children | 2 |
| Unbearable – mass grave, tied up and subjected to serious violence | 3 |
# Healing Injuries

After violent or frightening encounters, you and your friends may need to heal your Conditions. This section describes ways in which you can help each other. Some of this has already been mentioned in chapter 3, but is repeated here to avoid having to flip back and forth unnecessarily.

## Treating Critical Injuries

When you have sustained a critical injury that might either kill you or become chronic, someone must treat you with Healing or Inspiration before the time limit expires. If it succeeds, you cease to be Broken, while retaining all other Conditions. Extra successes can be used to heal additional Conditions. If the attempt fails, the person treating you must either find help, gather more medical supplies, or move you to a safer location before she can try again. If no one has successfully treated you before the time runs out, you either die or become permanently Broken. Then it is time to create a new player character

### Healing Cheat Sheet

|Action|Time|Description|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Treat critical injury|Round|Treat a Broken character with Healing or Inspiration during combat (each extra success heals an additional Condition)|
|Heal physical Conditions|Day|Use Healing in a safe location to heal three Conditions per success for someone else (including Broken)|
|Heal mental Conditions|Day|Use Inspiration in a safe space while having a close dialogue to heal three Conditions per success for someone else (including Broken)|
|Rest|Scene|Describe a scene together with one or several other PCs to recover from two Conditions (except Broken), once per day.|
|Services|Scene|Use Resources and describe a scene where you, alone or with friends, receive medical services (see separate table)|

## Healing Conditions

You can use Healing to heal other people’s physical Conditions, but not your own. You and your patients must spend a full day on treatment, in a secure location where you can drink, eat, and rest. You cannot do anything else that day.

Likewise, you can use Inspiration to cure others of their mental Conditions. In addition to spending a day, and having access to a safe place, food, and beverages, your friends must willingly engage in close contact and dialogue with you.

If the skill test succeeds, your patients heal a total of three Conditions which you distribute between them. They decide which Conditions are healed. Broken can also be healed this way. Each extra success can be used to heal another three Conditions. A failed skill test usually means that a day has been wasted, and may also give an enemy time to take further action against the characters.

A patient cannot have her physical or mental Conditions treated by more than one person at a time. However, it is possible for one person to treat the physical Conditions while another treats the mental ones. While you are treating the Conditions of others, you yourself may not receive treatment. That goes for both physical and mental Conditions.

### Prayer and Meditation

It is possible to heal your own Conditions by praying or meditating. Summarize what happens or play a short scene. This heals two mental or physical Conditions of your choice, although Broken cannot be healed this way. You can do this once per day, and cannot use Activities to heal simultaneously (see below). This does not count for Preparatory Prayer (see Chapter 3).

### Activities

It is possible to heal your own Conditions by engaging in an activity that provides relaxation and rest. Summarize what happens or play a short scene. The activity must involve at least one other person, NPC or player character. For example, you can have a conversation with someone or spend some time alone in the woods while a friend keeps watch nearby. Activities heal two mental or physical Conditions of your choice, although Broken cannot be healed this way. Even if multiple player characters are participating in the scene, only one will heal Conditions. You can heal Conditions through activities once per day, or as often as the Gamemaster sees fit.

**Examples of Activities:**

### Services and Establishments

Finally, it is possible to purchase medical attention or heal Conditions at a local physician’s office, by recuperating at some finer establishment, traveling lavishly, or resting at a nice home or inn. In this case, all participants may heal Conditions, and in addition, you can perform the activity yourself. In other words, seeking medical attention at an establishment can only be done in lieu of a regular activity. The difficulty of finding a service is measured from 1-3 as the availability.

|Services|Availability|Effect|

|Traditional Healer|1|Heals Broken|
|Skilled Physician|2|Heals Broken and one mental Condition|
|Personal Alchemyst or Wise Scholar|3|Heals Broken and any two Conditions|

# Defects and Insights

After completing an adventure, you will usually determine whether the Defects and Insights you have gained become permanent or wear off. The GM will decide when this happens, but it will usually be when significant, restful, time passes. This is done with a die roll called recovery. On a failure your Defects automatically become permanent and your Insights wear off before the next adventure. Insights and Defects that become permanent can never be removed.

If you have gained both physical and mental Insights or Defects, you make a physical recovery roll and a mental recover roll. The number and type of dice used for the physical recovery roll is determined by adding the values of your Strength and Agility together – for example, if you have Strength D6 and Agility D10, you would roll both dice, the D8 and the D10. For each success you may either heal a Defect or make an Insight permanent. For mental Defects and Insights you roll a number of dice equal to your combined Wits and Empathy. Each success heals a Defect or causes an Insight to become permanent. Conditions acquired during the adventure do not affect recovery rolls.

## Defects

Defects mean that your body has sustained an injury that will not heal, which makes life more difficult for you. A Defect can affect you once per session – the GM decides when. The GM can activate your Defect in the following ways:

- Increased difficulty: Adds a penalty to a skill test. The Defect states which skill it affects, and the modifier.
- Social stigma: A non-player character reacts negatively to meeting you. Your injury might make her afraid or hostile. The GM describes what happens.
- My own worst enemy: A situation which you would normally be able to handle now automatically requires a skill test. Perhaps you acquire a limp and must pass an Grace test to make your way up a hill.
- Loss of control: The GM assumes control of your actions in a certain situation. This only lasts for a brief moment – then you return to normal. Perhaps your traumatic memories make you question what a friend is saying, or gaps in your memory cause you to confuse important pieces of information?

## Insights

Insights change you, giving you supernatural powers beyond anything normal for a human. You can use an Insight once per gaming session. Insights can be used in the following ways:

- Increased skill: Adds a bonus to a skill test. The Insight states which skill it affects, and what the modifier is.
- Vision: You have a supernatural experience, a prophetic vision, or an intuitive understanding of a problem. This provides a clue you need to solve a problem or challenge. The GM sets the scene and might give you a clue. In some cases the Insight cannot be used this way. The GM decides.
- Open their eyes: You can give another human the ability to see spiritual being for the duration of one scene. When using this Insight, you must either touch the other person or say something that creates a strong emotional bond between you.
- Control my own destiny: You can use your Insight to control what an NPC is thinking or doing. The effect only lasts a moment and you cannot make her harm herself or her friends. The Game master may decide that an NPC cannot be controlled at the moment.

# Equipment

Your player character may need to procure weapons, armour, or other equipment. This is usually done during the mystery’s preparation phase, before leaving your Madinah, but it can also be done on site as the story unfolds. Rules for this are described below.

### Preparatory Equipment

Equipment has a level between 1 and 5 that indicates its availability – how easy it is to acquire. Equipment is mostly obtained through contacts and status, represented by your Resources value (see chapter 2). Your party is expected to procure equipment for any excursions outside the Madinah, before leaving. When preparing for a trip in this way, each player rolls the number of dice indicated by their character’s Resources value. The number of successes is used to purchase equipment – for example, an item with availability level 1 costs one success, while another with level 3 costs three successes. You can donate successes to each other, or add them together to purchase higher level equipment and decide among yourselves who will carry the equipment, regardless of whose successes paid for it. Each player may also decide to move points from their free Capital, but will then have less money to spend while outside of the Madinah (see below).

### Shopping inside the Madinah

While inside the Madinah, PCs are expected to have money, status, or goods that correspond to their respective living standards. When bartering with a non-player character who is reluctant to part with an item, you make an opposed roll for Inspiration and add a bonus based on your living standard (table Modifier from Resources). Equipment is bought by achieving a number of successes equal to or greater than the equipment’s availability level.

For normal purchases, from someone willing to sell at a fixed price, the Resources value is rolled to see how much money (or what promise of future payment) the player character is good for. Rich individuals can automatically purchase equipment during an ongoing adventure by spending Capital (table Modifier from Resources), as long as it is not done with an opposed roll. The point is spent until the next adventure and can be used instead of a success test or added to increase the number of successes.

### Modifier from Resources

|Resources|Living Standards|Bonus|Capital|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|Destitute|-1|-|
|2|Poor|-|-|
|3|Struggling|-|1|
|4|Financially stable|+1|2|
|5|Middle-class|+1|3|
|6|Well-off|+2|5|
|7|Wealthy|+3|8|
|8|Filthy rich|+5|12|

## Body Armour

Body armour can protect you from damage. Armour doesn’t provide protection from other kinds of damage, or from damage you inflict on yourself when you push a roll. The effect of armour is determined by its armour rating, and is measured via dice type (D6, D8, D10, D12) just like attributes and skills. When you suffer damage from a physical attack, roll two dice corresponding to the armour rating. Every success you roll decreases the damage by one. This roll does not count as an action and cannot be pushed.

|Type|Armor Rating|Grace Modifier|Availability|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Light Armour|D6|-1|2|
|Medium Armour|D8|-2|3|
|Heavy Armour|D10|-3|4|

## Equipment & Tools

Tools, weapons, and other items help you by adding a bonus to your skill tests. The bonus indicates the number of extra dice you may roll. See the Equipment list for examples of items from each availability level. You may also visit various establishments or purchase services that can make things easier during the mystery or serve as a place for healing Conditions. Each service applies to the whole party, rather than any individual character. For examples, see the Services and Establishments list. The Weapons table shows a list of weapons the characters might use. Damage indicates how many Conditions the opponent suffers if hit. Range shows which zones you can reach with your attack. Range 0–1 means you can attack enemies in your zone and adjacent zones, while 1–3 means you can attack enemies one, two, or three zones away, but not enemies in your own zone. Bonus indicates how many dice you may add to your success test when trying to hit your enemy. Skill shows which skill to roll for. Availability indicates how difficult the weapon is to obtain.

## Mounts

A horse or other riding animal can be a useful asset. The animal can carry gear for you, and you can take advantage of being in the saddle during combat.

**Movement:** Mounts allow you to move faster in combat than on foot. When making a move action, make a Grace roll – for each success, you may move an additional zone. Mounts generally can’t move into Cramped zones at all. In Cluttered zones, they can only move one zone per action.

**Move:** When you are on horseback and make a Grace roll, use the animal’s Grace instead of your own.

**Bladework:** You can fight from horseback, but only with one-handed weapons. Opponents attacking you must decide if they attack you or the horse. Attacks against a mounted rider suffer a −1 penalty.

**Marksmanship:** All ranged attacks from horseback suffer a −2 modification. Opponents shooting at you must decide if they attack you or the horse.

**Damage:** Your mount can suffer damage, just like you, through attacks or by pushing rolls when you are using the animal’s attribute score. Animals recover damage just like PCs. An animal that has its Strength reduced to zero does not suffer a critical injury, instead it is considered perished. Animals generally don’t have Wits or Empathy.
