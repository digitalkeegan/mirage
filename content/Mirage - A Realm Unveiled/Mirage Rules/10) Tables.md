# Non-player Characters

As Gamemaster, it is your job to create and play NPCs. Give the character some descriptive detail and let her develop over the course of play. Some characters will only appear for a few seconds in a single scene, while others recur in multiple sessions. To make things easier you can roll once or twice on the NPC Traits table. NPCs have skill and attributes values. These are only used in conflicts with player characters. When two NPCs come into conflict with each other, you decide what happens. NPCs cannot pray on their rolls. Instead of Conditions, NPCs have mental and physical Toughness. Toughness works the same as Conditions. Each point of damage inflicted on the NPC adds a –1 modifier to the corresponding skill tests (mental or physical). 

As soon as the total amount of damage exceeds her Toughness value, the NPC becomes Broken. A Broken NPC is usually taken out for good. If the damage is physical the NPC dies. Most NPCs have 1 point in physical and mental Toughness. In other words, they can either take two physical or two mental injuries before becoming Broken. Named NPCs who are important to the mystery have Toughness 2. Some unique NPCs, such as powerful magicians or the main characters of a campaign, can have Toughness 3. 

NPCs and animals do not usually recover Toughness during a adventure – once damaged they stay damaged. The only exception is if they receive medical attention from the player characters, or if a lot of time has passed and they have had a chance to rest. You do not have to establish an NPC’s stats until they become relevant in the game. When that happens, have a look at the table that indicates what type of dice she gets to roll for her main skill. You may then set the other values, which should be a step or two lower.

> It is possible for some human NPCs to use magic. Give your NPC a Speciality, just like you would for PCs this will give them access to one or several magical powers.
