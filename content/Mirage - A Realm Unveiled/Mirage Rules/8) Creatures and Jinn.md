### Creatures
The umbrella terms for all beasts, spirits, jinn, and constructs are "creatures". Different kinds of creatures will behave and act differently - some will have access to praying, magic, and other skills, while others won't. 

# Rules for Creatures

Creatures do not have skills, but they do have a variety of Attributes: Might, Agility, Magic, Manipulation, Fear, and Crystalpower. These behave the same way as other Attributes when it comes to opposing rolls and other tests. The value indicates the type of dice rolled. They cannot pray over a roll. Remember that you do not roll dice when creatures are trying to attack or affect NPCs â€“ in such situations, the GM decide what happens. Not every creature has every one of these Attributes. 

In combat, creatures get one slow and one fast action per turn, unless otherwise specified. Certain creatures have some form of Protection, which works the same as armour.

## Creature Attributes

- **Might** is used for attacking, heavy lifting, or resisting fire and other kinds of damage.
- **Agility** is used for evading attacks, chasing, fleeing, stealing things, sneaking, or detecting someone who is sneaking.
- **Manipulation** is used for deceiving or persuading the player characters, or for seeing through their lies.
- **Magic** is used for casting or resisting magical powers. More is described below in the Jinn Powers section below.
- **Fear**  is used when the player characters see the creature for the first time. The value indicates how many successes they need to pass their Fear test and not become Terrified (see chapter 5). Some creatures remain frightening even after the initial encounter; these have a second value that is used in subsequent encounters with the creature. Details can be found in the Jinn Rules section below. 
- **Crystalpower** is used to track how much energy a construct has. At the beginning of each round of combat the power is reduced by 1. When it is reduced to 0, the construct is not dead, but enters a regeneration state - the length of time differs depending on the construct. Details can be found in the Construct Rules section below.

# Animals

If player characters are facing animals in combat, the animals attack with Might and use Agility for sneaking or evading attacks. The Toughness and attack damage of various animals are listed in the table below.

| Animal | Might | Agility | Toughness | Damage |
| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---|
| Badger | D8+D8 | D8+D8 | 1 | 1 |
| Bear | D10+D12 | D8+D10 | 3 | 2 |
| Dog | D8+D8 | D10+D12 | 1 | 1 |
| Eagle | D8+D8 | D10+D12 | 1 | 1 |
| Fox | D6+D8 | D10+D12 | 1 | 1 |
| Moose | D10+D12 | D6+D8 | 3 | 2 |
| Reindeer | D6+D8 | D8+D8 | 1 | 1 |
| Wild boar | D8+D8 | D10+D12 | 2 | 1 |
| Wolf | D8+D10 | D10+D12 | 2 | 1 |
| Wolverine | D8+D8 | D10+D12 | 1 | 1 |
| Griffin | D8+D10 | D12+D12 | 4 | 3 |
| Manticore | D8+D10 | D8+D10 | 4 | 2 |
| Serpent | D10+D12 | D8+D10 | 3 | 2 |
# Constructs

 Amidst the shifting magic of Al-Sarab, some ancient constructs have begun to come "alive" once more. These golems, war machines, or small mechanical workers are relics of the First Worshippers, and their creation and maintenance go far beyond the current knowledge of those that call Al-Sarab home. Some wreak havoc, while others stand as guardians, protectors of the ancient knowledge embedded within their metallic sinews.

### Crystalpower
Crystalpower (CP) is essentially how much energy a construct has. This power most likely comes from the crystals found within the construct, though magic is clearly involved. This Attribute not only affects how long the Construct can move and act, but can also determine how powerful its attacks are or how quickly it moves.  

 At the beginning of each round of combat CP is reduced by 1. When it is reduced to 0, the construct is not dead, but enters a regeneration state - the length of time differs depending on the construct. 

> [!example] For Example
> A Golem has a Crystalpower value of 4 and an Agility value of "D6+D8+CP".
> At the beginning of combat, the CP value will decrease to 3 as it has just powered on. If the Sentinel needs to roll an Agility check in this first round of combat, it would roll a D10+D10 (a D6+D8 with a +3 modifier). Then, in the second round of combat the CP would decrease to 2, and so it would roll D10+D8 on Agility that round (a D6+D8 with a +2 modifier).


## Crystalworkers

## Golems

Towering over the landscape like titans of old, these majestic constructs are crafted from the very essence of the earth itself, their forms hewn from the crystalline heart of the desert. Each golem bears the mark of its creators, with intricate patterns etched into its rock, crystal, or metallic frame, symbols of power and protection that have withstood the test of time.

Their eyes, aglow with the ethereal light of ancient magic, pierce through the darkness, scanning the horizon with unwavering vigilance. The air crackles with energy in their presence, the hum of their crystal cores echoing across the barren landscape, a constant reminder of the power that courses through their veins. To those who dare to approach, the golems exude an aura of both awe and dread, their imposing stature a testament to the might and majesty of the First Worshippers who fashioned them from the very elements of the earth. In their gaze lies the wisdom of ages past, a silent testament to the secrets buried beneath the shifting sands.

In battle, golems are unstoppable forces of nature, their movements fluid yet deliberate, their strikes devastating in their precision. The are said to wield the strength of a thousand storms, their crystalline fists shattering stone and bone alike, their relentless pursuit of their foes a testament to their unwavering commitment to their duty. To face a golem is to face the wrath of the ancients themselves, a trial of strength and will against a foe as timeless as the desert sands.

# Jinn

This part of the chapter begins by explaining what jinn are, and what relations are like between them and humans. This information should be kept from your players at all cost, as it would make the game less mysterious and fun to play. This section will describe the nature of jinn and give some examples of where they might be encountered. 

The next section provides rules for magic that jinn can use, both to affect the area where the adventure takes place and to attack the player characters. There are also rules and characteristics for jinn, along with information on how to handle conflicts between them and the player characters. In addition, we present rules for (and examples of) special or magic items that can be used either by jinn or by humans hoping to protect themselves from such creatures. But above all, this chapter details specific jinn that humans might encounter in their adventures in Al-Sarab. These are examples of creatures, not an exhaustive list of every jinn in existence.

## The Nature of Jinn

To begin, jinn exist "beyond the veil" - in the spirit realm. Humans have so little interaction with this space that belief in what it is varies drastically, from a separate reality, to the place where the dead reside, to a simple belief that jinn can simply turn invisible. None of these really captures the entire truth of the matter, though it does come close. When those that live in Al-Sarab refer to "beyond the veil" they are, in fact, referencing a separate realm. This realm is not a one-to-one copy of Al-Sarab - a sort of immaterial, invisible part of the material dimension. Instead is an entire world in-of-itself, a dimension governed by completely different spiritual and magical principles. This realm is home to the jinn - the catch-all term for any being that crosses over from the spiritual realm to Al-Sarab.

This realm *is technically* accessible to humans, but those who live in Al-Sarab have no context for how this would fit into their worldview. Few non-jinn ever travel between the dream realm and Al-Sarab, and even when they have it was seen as myth or legend. If anyone were to claim that they had done this physically (rather then from within a dream or as part of a vision or hallucination), they would almost certainly be considered mad. The dream realm is also inhabited by all manner of other creatures, the vast majority of which cannot even enter Al-Sarab - making the jinn who move between the realms all the more special. 

Jinn are usually neither good nor evil, just like humans. That said, just like humans, it is also clear that some have taken to evil wholeheartedly, seeking to tempt humans into violence. These come in many forms and are called many names, including Divs and Ifrit. Others seem to be significantly more benevolent, often called the Peri. Because jinn can often change their appearance at will - and most do in fact show themselves in a variety of shapes and sizes - humans are innately suspicious of any and all jinn. This belief is pervasive, even though jinn do not usually meddle in human affairs. Some humans believe there are many and that they just prefer to live with their own kind - others simply believe them to be few in number. Others believe that those who come from the beyond clearly do so to meddle in the "real" world. 

Jinn are also, clearly, magical in a variety of ways. In the eyes of humans, these powers can look extreme and dangerous. It's clear that some of them can bend time and space, conjure new creatures, and rejuvenate or transform humans. It's also clear that the jinn have access to a magical world with strange regions located underground or in a different reality.


> [!info] Types of Jinn
The jinn that cross from the spirit world into Al-Sarab come in many different shapes and sizes. Although categorizing them would be impossible, an attempt would look something like this:
> **Elementals** are jinn closely associated with specific elements, or geographical locations. This would include the likes of ifrits and marids, as well as the peris.
> **Shape-shifters**, **spirits**, and **tricksters** are jinn that are well known to trip, deceive, or test humans or other jinn. These would include the si'lat and ghawwas, but would also include the Anuk, ghouls, and arwahs.
> The spiritual realm includes many kind of **mythical creatures**, some of which sometimes find themselves in Al-Sarab. This would include creatures like the al-mi'raj and karkadann, as well as grander being like the Rukh and Simurgh.

## Jinn Powers

Jinn have access to magical powers which can be used to attack enemies, frighten people, and alter reality. As Gamemaster, you should use their powers to create an atmosphere and give your mysteries a sense of danger. 

These powers are categorised into three types for games of Mirage: Enchantments, Curses, and Spiritcraft. Some Jinn have access to all types, while others can only use one or two. They can also have specific powers, such as the ability to move with immense speed. Jinn can use magic in a variety of ways â€“ they can speak words of power, recite incantations, sprinkle magic powder, concoct potions, or even summon other jinn. Usually the player characters will not see the magic being performed, but merely suffer its effects. 

While in combat, Enchantments, Curses, and Spiritcraft are all considered magic, and so can be interacted with in the same way as the magic that PCs have access to, see Chapter 6 for more on Magic. 

Curses and Spiritcraft can be used in combat as a slow action. The creature must be able to see or otherwise perceive the player character. All PCs may use a fast action to resist the magic, usually using Intuition. If she does not, the creature only needs one success in order to succeed. The range of magic is Engaged to Medium. In combat, Curses and Enchantments that normally last hours or longer remain active for 1D6 rounds. Each round, the player character can use a fast action to resist magic from Jinn. If it succeeds, the magic is canceled.

> [!warning] Magic, not Competition 
Jinn powers are not meant to defeat and eliminate the player characters. They are tools for creating exciting stories. Use them in moderation. Let them reveal the existence of the creature and say something about who or what it is.

### Enchantments
Enchantments are magic that affects the location and the people living there, and sometimes the player characters as well. The village might be enshrouded in a thick fog, the food starts to rot before the charactersâ€™ eyes, or maybe the water in the village well turns into blood? The main function of Enchantments is to create an atmosphere. You do not roll to see whether a creature succeeds with an Enchantment â€“ they succeed automatically. Player characters affected by an Enchantment must pass a Fear test with Fear 1 (see chapter 5 for information on Fear). Extreme situations might call for a higher Fear value. Enchantments usually last a couple hours, but you are free to increase their duration as you see fit.

Enchantments may include: 
- Commanding, controlling, or altering animals
- Inflicting blindness 
- Communication and interaction with the spiritual realm
- Inflicting darkness 
- Distorting vision or causing waking nightmares
- Enchanted sleep over an area
- Enthralling creatures
- Creating fog 
- Food or beverage is transformed or rots 
- Causing muteness
- Significant and near-instant plant growth 
- Extreme plant death
- Shaping stone or wood 
- Spreading disease 
- Creating natural disasters, like storms and earthquakes
- Instigating terrible signs and portents

### Curses
Curses are magic that jinn can use to attack the player characters. It can happen from a distance without the player characters knowing where the creature is, or be used as a weapon in combat situations. For the magic to succeed, the creature must win an opposed roll â€“ its Magic against a player characterâ€™s Skill. Which skill the PC must use is specified in parentheses next to each Curse. The player characters may pray on the roll, but the creature may not. For the Curse to succeed, the creature must roll more successes than the player character. The effect of a successful roll is described next to each Curse. Extra successes usually cause the player character to suffer Conditions. If the creature and the player character get an equal number of successes, nothing happens, except that the player character may sense that someone is trying to influence or attack her through supernatural means. If the player character rolls a greater number of successes, she wins the opposed roll and has not only resisted the magic, but gained the upper hand over that jinn. What this means is up to you â€“ perhaps she gains a free success to her Fear test when she sees the creature, or may add an extra die to a future skill test, or maybe she heals a Condition. Some Curses affect multiple player characters. Each character must then roll individually, while the creature makes a single roll. Some Curses come with certain requirements: the creature might have to steal a lock of the player characterâ€™s hair, or be physically near her. Curses usually last around an hour, unless stated otherwise. In combat it takes a slow action to perform a Curse.

|  |  |
| ---- | ---- |
| Deadly Cold (Endurance): The player character is struck by extreme cold which deals 1 damage. Extra successes deal additional physical damage | Mute (MIght): The player character is unable to speak. Extra successes deal physical damage |
| Enthrall (Intuition): The creature controls the player characterâ€™s actions. Extra successes deal mental damage. The victim cannot be made to hurt herself. Some creatures need access to an item belonging to the player character in order to Enthrall her. You either assume control of the player character for the rest of the scene, or instruct the player through notes or a secret conversation about how the character must act. | Fear (Fear test): The player character is tormented by dreadful visions, thoughts, scents, or other sensations. The number of successes rolled by the creature determines the Fear value. |
| Feast (Endurance): The player characters are seized by an overwhelming urge to party and indulge themselves. Extra successes deal mental damage. Affects all player characters. | Fire (Might): The player character catches fire. A small part of the body is burning. Extra successes increase the intensity or size of the fire. |
| Infect (Endurance): The player character contracts a terrible disease which deals 1 damage. Extra successes deal additional physical damage. The disease must be cured with Healing. The creature may require some of the player characterâ€™s hair or skin, which if destroyed cures the disease. | Lame (Might): The player character is unable to walk. Extra successes deal physical damage. |
| Lure (Intuition): The player character feels compelled to get to the creature, and will try to break through any obstacle with violence or cunning. Extra successes deal mental damage. | Wound (Might): A wound opens on the player characterâ€™s body, dealing 1 damage. Extra successes deal additional physical damage. |
| Night Terror (Observation): The player character is plagued by severe nightmares. She cannot be woken up for a number of hours and takes 1 mental damage. Extra successes deal additional mental damage. Can only be used on sleeping player characters. | Seduce (Intuition): The player character is attracted to the creature. Extra successes deal mental damage. |
| Self-Loathing (Intuition): The player character hates or disgusts herself, and cannot stop thinking about it. Extra successes deal mental damage. | Sleep (Might): The player character falls asleep and cannot be woken up. Extra successes deal mental damage. The creature must have placed some kind of item in the victimâ€™s bedroom. If the item is removed, the player character wakes up. |
| Stranger (Observation): Something about the player character makes other people dislike her and want to hurt her or drive her away. Each extra success extends the duration of the effect by one scene. The creature must have access to an item belonging to the player character. Retrieving the item lifts the curse. | Twist Vision (Observation): The player character experiences reality differently. She might view the villagers as monsters, or think that her friends have been replaced by monsters. Extra successes deal mental damage. |

### Spiritcraft
Spiritcraft is a form of magic that involves bending time and space or altering reality in various ways. When Spiritcraft is used to set the mood and create a certain atmosphere, for example by hiding a village within a mirage, or turning back time every night, it technically works the same way as Enchantments. The creature succeeds automatically, and the player character makes a Fear test when suffering its effects. When Spiritcraft is used to attack a player character, for example by transforming her into a shrew or shrinking her to the size of a teaspoon, it works just as it does with Curses. The creature makes an opposed roll using Magic, and the player character must pass a skill test to resist its effect. The creature must roll more successes than the player character in order to succeed.


| Enchantment and Effect                                                | Enchantment and Effect                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Alter Age (Might): One or multiple people grow older or younger. Extra successes deal mental damage. The Gamemaster decides whether it affects one or multiple player characters, and whether the aging is permanent or temporary. If it is permanent, the Gamemaster should provide clues about how the player character can regain her true age by tracking down jinn or performing strange rituals â€“ this is preferably made into a separate adventure. | Stop Time (Observation): Time in the locality stands still. This can mean that everything outside its borders is frozen in time while everything and everyone else keeps aging, or that the same day keeps repeating over and over in a time loop. The player character must kill or banish the creature, or make it undo the Spiritcraft for time to go back to normal. If Stop Time is used to attack a player character, she may be frozen and unable to move, but also immune to damage and other effects. |
| Animate the Inanimate (Fear test): Something that is not alive comes to life and is controlled by the creature. This may sometimes require player characters to make a Fear test. The formerly inanimate matter can be used as a warrior in combat, with stats like one of the animals listed in the table earlier in this chapter. Choose an animal according to the shape and size of the warrior.<br><br>The number of successes rolled by the creature determines the Fear value. | Transform into Animals (Might): The victims turn into animals, while retaining their mental faculties. Affects one or multiple player characters. The creature must come within ten meters of the player characters, or be in the same zone during combat. |
| Enlarge (Force): The victim grows to the size of a small bayt (house). Each extra success extends the duration by an hour or so. The GM decides whether it affects one or multiple player characters. | Mix Thoughts (Intuition): The victimsâ€™ thoughts are jumbled together, and they must each pass a Fear test with Fear 1. Extra successes deal mental damage. Affects all player characters. |
| Obstruct (Might): The victim cannot get past a certain point or move in a certain direction. Each extra success extends the duration by one scene. Affects one or multiple player characters. | Passion (Intuition): The victim falls fiercely in love with another person. Each extra success extends the duration by one scene. |
| Shrink (Might): The victims shrink to the size of an insect. Each extra success extends the duration by an hour or so. The GM decides whether it affects one or multiple player characters. | Animal Parts (Might): The victim has a body part or two turned into those of an animal, such as donkeyâ€™s ears or a pigâ€™s tail. Extra successes escalate the transformation. |
| Teleport (Might): Something or someone is sent to a different location. Extra successes deal mental damage. Affects one or multiple player characters. | Thought Virus (Intuition): A firm belief spreads among people as if it were true. Extra successes deal mental damage. Lasts for the duration of the mystery or until the creature dies. Affects all player characters. |
| Dance (Intuition): The victim is forced to dance until the music stops. Extra successes deal mental damage. Affects one or multiple player characters. |                                                                        |


## Rules for Jinn

When jinn are injured they suffer Conditions. They do not have separate Conditions for physical and mental injuries, but specific Conditions that are exclusive to them. The creaturesâ€™ Conditions are listed in their specific descriptions and are always checked from the top down. A creatureâ€™s current Condition determines its dice modifier and does not stack with previous Conditions. The modifier affects their other Attributes, but not Fear. Each Condition gives you as Gamemaster a suggestion on how the creature might act. As with player characters, you always roll at least one die, as long as the creature is not Broken. What happens when the creature becomes Broken is specified for each jinn. Once the specified effect of Broken has occurred, the creature heals all Conditions. The creature also heals all Conditions if it is left alone for an extended period of time without being threatened by the player characters.

> [!important] Terrifying Jinn
> Jinn come with the Fear Attribute When the player characters see the creature for the first time, they must roll a Fear test against this value (see chapter 5). Next time they see the creature they know what to expect and are not required to make a Fear test. Fear 0 means that the characters do not have to make a Fear test, even if they have never encountered it before. Some particularly horrid jinn never stop being terrifying. They have two Fear values â€“ one that is used in the player characterâ€™s first encounter with the creature and one for subsequent encounters. For example, such a creature might have Fear 3/1. Fear 3 is used in the initial encounter, and 1 in those that follow.


### Banishing Jinn
Some Jinn can be banished, bound, killed, or lulled to sleep by performing rituals. The ritual is specific to each jinn, and may differ between jinn of the same type.

The players do not roll dice when performing the ritual â€“ they describe what their characters are doing, and if performed correctly, the ritual succeeds. In combat you must decide how many rounds it takes to complete the ritual. The ritual takes effect immediately upon completion â€“ the creature vanishes into thin air, falls asleep, or is forced to leave. All effects of its magical powers are disrupted. 

### Physical Attacks
Physical attacks are a creatureâ€™s way of dealing damage in combat. Everything from a ghulâ€™s claws, to the massive sword of an ifrit, to the brute force of a nasnas.

### Specific Powers
Some jinn have specific abilities or powers. It might be the ability to fly, or shapeshift, or getting to act before players in combat. Some jinn may even be able to perform a total of two slow and two fast actions each round.

### Items of Power and Magic Items
Items of power are things that people in the Al-Sarab have traditionally used to protect themselves against jinn. The player characters may come across them during their adventures. Items of power are used by rolling 1D6. On a roll of one, the item breaks, runs out, or stops working. Conversely, Magic Items are things owned and wielded by jinn. After banishing a jinn, the player characters may sometimes come across things the creature leaves behind. For a player character, however, using them always comes with a risk. Roll 1D6 hidden from the players every time one of their characters uses a magic item. A one means that the player character is negatively affected â€“ what happens then is described under Risk in the Magic Items table. Jinn can use their own items without risk. The two tables below containing items of power and magic items are examples of things that might appear in adventures â€“ they are not exhaustive lists of every item in existence. Use the lists as inspiration when creating your own items.

#### Items of Power
| Item | Effect | Description |

| Tome of Serenity | Adds Empathy to Wits rolls against jinn enchantments. | Ancient manuscript inscribed with verses of inner peace, crafted by enlightened sages of Al-Sarab |
| Veil of Ancestry | Grants +2 against jinn curses. -1 to all Observation rolls while worn. | Ethereal veil woven from threads spun by the first mystics, shielding wearers from malevolent influences. |
| Sunfire Amulet | +1 to rolls when defending against attacks from an ifrit. | Glowing pendant infused with the essence of solar flames, forged in the heart of Al-Sarab's scorching deserts |
| Breeze Whisperer | +2 Grace against any flying jinn. | Ornate necklace adorned with feathers from the mythical Roc, offering protection from elusive spirits |
#### Magic Items

| Wand made from an Al-Mi-raj | Can cast one or more Enchantments, Curses or Trollcraft spells. Gains the skill Magic D8 | The wand breaks and the magic affects the player character |
| Simurgh feather | Can pass through locked doors | The player character ends up somewhere else |

##  Jinn

### Al-Mi'raj

The Al-Mi'raj is a whimsical jinn, embodying the essence of mischief and magic. Resembling a rabbit adorned with a single spiralling horn, it roams the dunes and oases of the desert, delighting in playful antics and curious adventures. With its luminous eyes gleaming like stars in the night sky, the Al-Mi'raj possesses an otherworldly charm that captivates those who encounter it. Tales abound of its mischievous escapades, from leading travellers astray with illusory paths to casting whimsical spells that confound the senses. Yet, despite its playful nature, the Al-Mi'raj is not without its perils, as its tricks can disrupt the delicate balance of magic and reality, they can disrupt anchors if their horn scratches the crystal - what's worse is that it seems that they love to do this.

> [!entry] *As the sun dipped below the horizon...*
> *casting the desert sands in a golden hue, I stumbled upon a curious sight: a creature straight from the tales of old. With its ivory fur shimmering in the fading light and a horn that spiraled towards the heavens, the Al-Mi'raj danced playfully amidst the dunes. Its eyes, aglow with an otherworldly radiance, held a hint of mischief as it beckoned me closer with a flick of its delicate ears. Mesmerised by its enchanting presence, I found myself drawn into a world of whimsy and wonder, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blurred with each graceful leap. In that fleeting moment, amidst the shifting sands and starlit skies, I glimpsed the magic that dwelled within the heart of the desert, forever changing the course of my journey.*

### Aaperi

The aaperi are mystical beings that manifests as a shimmering presence, often appearing near places of magical significance or during moments of great import. With ethereal wings that catch the light and glowing eyes that seem to hold ancient wisdom, the aaperi can take on various forms, appearing to some as a small human donned in flowing robes, while to others, it resembles a radiant bird with iridescent feathers. Known for its association with the peri and its role as a messenger or companion, the aaperi embodies qualities of curiosity, mischief, and benevolence. They possess an innate affinity for the magical and the mysterious, serving as guides and guardians in the enchanted realms of Al-Sarab.

> [!entry] *Today, as I traversed the undulating dunes...*
> *I stumbled upon a mesmerizing sight: an aaperi, its iridescent wings casting a kaleidoscope of colours against the desert sky. Whether manifested as a celestial nymph or an ethereal bird, its presence was a symphony of grace and mystery, stirring the depths of my soul with whispers of forgotten lore and untold wonders. In its luminous gaze, I glimpsed the essence of magic, a fleeting glimpse into realms beyond mortal comprehension. Though our encounter was fleeting, the memory of the aaperi's otherworldly presence lingers, a silent testament to the boundless enchantment that weaves through the sands of Al-Sarab.*

### Ifrit

The Ifrit embody the essence of fire and chaos. Formed out of smoke and flame they seek to ensnare and cause harm to others. Often depicted as towering figures wreathed in flames, with eyes like burning coals and skin as dark as smoke, ifrits command fear and respect in equal measure. These beings are said to be born from the fires of the desert, arising from the hottest depths of the earth's core. Masters of elemental flame, ifrits possess immense strength and cunning intellect, wielding fire as both a weapon and a tool of manipulation. Legends speak of their fiery tempers and insatiable desires, as well as their propensity for granting wishes with malicious intent. While some ifrit may be malevolent and vengeful, others are bound by ancient pacts and compelled to serve mortals, albeit begrudgingly. Their presence is often associated with volcanic regions, desolate wastelands, and hidden caverns where the earth's molten heart beats closest to the surface.

**Secret**
The only way to truly trap an ifrit is to encase it in brass armbands - usually by trickery. Nothing else comes close. If they are trapped, keeping them in brass bottles is also possible. The only way to kill an ifrit permanently is to envelope it in liquid brass.
