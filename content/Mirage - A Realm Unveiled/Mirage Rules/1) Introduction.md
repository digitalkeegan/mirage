## The Basics

This section introduces some key concepts in roleplaying, and how they are used in games of Mirage.

### The Players

Each player except one controls a player character (PC). You decide what your PC thinks and feels, what they say and do – but not what happens to them. It is your job as a player to immerse yourself in your PC. They may be an adventurer in a faraway fantasy world – but they are still, at heart, a person with feelings and dreams, just like you. Try to imagine – how would you react if you were in their shoes? What would you do? The player characters are always the protagonists of the story. The game is about you. Your decisions, your adventures.

### The Gamemaster

The final player is the Gamemaster, the GM. They describe the game world to you, they portray the people you meet, and they control the enemies you fight. The game is a conversation between the players and the GM, back and forth, until a critical situation arises where the outcome is uncertain. Then it’s time to break out the dice. It is the GM’s job to put obstacles in your path and challenge your PCs, forcing them to show what they’re really made of. But it is not up to the GM to decide everything that happens in the game – and above all, not how your story is supposed to end. That is decided in the game. That is why you are playing the game – to find out how your story ends.

## Tools of the Game

### Character Sheets

To document your character, you use a character sheet. How you create your character will be described in the next chapter.

### Dice

As a character in Mirage, you will have to take risks. Sooner or later, you will end up in situations where the outcome is uncertain, no matter how skilled you are. It’s time to break out the dice. The Mirage uses polyhedral dice, including D6, D8, D10 and D12. It is also recommended that you have each set of dice in a couple of different colours - though not necessary.

#### Chance of Success on Initial Roll
| Attribute/Skill | D6 | D8 | D10 | D12 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| - | 17% | 38% | 50% | 58% |
| D6 | 31% | 49% | 59% | 65% |
| D8 | 49% | 61% | 69% | 74% |
| D10 | 59% | 69% | 75% | 79% |
| D12 | 65% | 74% | 79% | 82% |
#### Chance of Success on Prayed on Roll
| Attribute/Skill | D6 | D8 | D10 | D12 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| - | 31% | 62% | 75% | 82% |
| D6 | 52% | 74% | 83% | 88% |
| D8 | 74% | 85% | 90% | 93% |
| D10 | 83% | 90% | 93% | 96% |
| D12 | 88% | 93% | 96% | 97% |

### Playing Safely

In The Mirage, you are largely in control of the story, and with this comes responsibility. The player characters will face great danger and difficult challenges, but no player should find the situations they experience unpleasant or offensive. It is important that everyone around the gaming table is having fun and feeling safe.

Before starting the game, talk things through and see if someone wants certain subjects to be kept out of the game. Always respect a player who wants to pause and discuss what is happening in the game, or even leave the table if the player so chooses. And you may also want to talk about what happened after the game session.

### Measuring Time

There are a number of units used to measure time in Mirage games, depending on the situation at hand. See the table below. The exact duration of a round and stretch can vary depending on the situation. It’s the GM’s job to track time and determine when another round, stretch or quarter-day has passed. There are typically four quarter-days in a day: morning, day, evening, and night.

|Unit of Time|Duration|Often Used In |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Round|5–10 seconds|Combat|
|Stretch|5–10 minutes|Exploration|
|Hours|1-6 Hours|Healing|
|Quarter-day|approx. 6 hours |Travel and Learning|
|Day|24 hours|Travel and Healing|
### Chapters and the Prologue

Games of Mirage are told in Chapters. Chapters may span multiple sessions, though it is more likely that you go through one to two chapters per session. The first couple of sessions as called the "Prologue" - a renaming of a common tool usually referred to as "Session 0". The Prologue in games of Mirage often span two whole sessions, particularly if players get stuck into player creation, or if the sessions are especially short. This is normal, and one of the reasons why we avoid calling it "Session 0" and thus imply it will only take a single session. The Prologue will usually include the following:

- **Character creation** - Each player will create their character while filling out their character sheet. This includes forming your relationships, something that might take up a good portion of the session. See Chapter 2 for information. 
- **Madinah creation** - The players will work together to fill in details about the home they come from - their madinah. This will often tie together aspects of their relationships and roles in their group. See Chapter 7 for information. 
- **Player Safety** - The Prologue is the best time to have a discussion around player safety, including going over any safety tools that are being used and subjects that will be avoided.
- **Basic game mechanics** -  It is recommended that every player read through the rules, but many Gamemasters will take time to confirm everyone is on the same page during the Prologue. In particular they will often go through how and when to roll dice in games of Mirage. See Chapter 3 for more information.
